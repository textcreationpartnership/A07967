            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>One, in that Princes are truly intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not only in their Subiects goods of Fortune, but euen in their Intellectuall goods of the Mynd; and therefore hovv ſmal ſoeuer my Talent is herein, it ought to be appropriated and referred to your ſeruyce.</p>

            <p>Novv ſeing your Maieſty hath made ſuch a happy declaration in the beliefe of this high Myſtery, I thought it my duty (ſoluing aforehand all ſuch difficultyes, as may ſeeme in a vulgar Eye to imply an Impoſſibility thereof) to publish to the vvorld the chiefe Reaſons vvhich do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your former receaued doctrine; and

               </gap> (vvhich do neceſſarily imply a true chang of one thing into another) are heerin frequently vſed by the Greeke Fathers.</p>
            <p>THIS THEN is that faith, vvhich vvas ſo vnanimouſly maintayned (as shall hereafter fully appeare) by the Reuerend Doctours of the Primitiue Church, and no leſſe religiouſly belieued by ſo many of your Royall Anceſtours, and particulerly by that moſt vertuous and renovvned Queene, your Maieſtyes deare Mother; to vvhom it vvas granted by God, that she <hi>should vvash her robes in the bloud of the Lambe:</hi> A Princeſſe, in vvhom abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Goodnes at length

            <p>This Mercy vve humbly beſeech at your hands, euen for his ſake, vvho out of a ſea of Mercy vvas content to abaſe himſelfe to the opprobrious death of the Croſſe; for the Honour and Loue of him, vvhoſe Image not only by Creation, but in Gouerment all Princes are <hi>(Ego dixi Dij eſtis)</hi> and therfore are bound the more zealouſly to imitate him in his moſt glorious title of Mercy; euen by that hope of Mercy, vvhich your Maieſty appearing before the Diuine Maieſty, at the moſt dreadfull Day, doth expect to obtayne: Finally for the deare remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that bleſſed Princeſſe your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvho dyed (I vvill not ſay chiefly

            <p>The reaſon why the Sacramentaryes do belieue the words of Chriſt in the doctrine of the Euchariſt ſo little, is becauſe they belieue their Senſe therin ſo much: for they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that their outward ſenſe shall heere euen preſcribe Lawes to their faith; &amp; whatſoeuer may ſeeme to be inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patible therwith (as the forme, the colour, the taſt &amp;c.) the maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof to be reputed as an exploded Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

               <hi>The ſecond Part</hi> heerof iuſtifying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties learned Iudgment heerin, deliuereth the diuine Authorities of both the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for confirmation of the <hi>Reall Preſence:</hi> it contayneth the Propheſies of the ancient <hi>Rabbyns</hi> therof; it reporteth the Myracles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by God in warrant of the ſame; it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the weakneſſe of ſuch teſtimonyes as are out of the Scripture obiected to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And though thou shalt find there all ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes fully explaned, yet it is queſtionable, whether thou art able (preſuming thee to be ſuch an one, as heere I meane) to apprehend the Anſweres as well as the Doubtes: for a weake and confuſed iudgment may ſuggeſt or conceaue difficulties, but it is a cleare Iudgment, that muſt reſolue them.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13333:18"/> therin others (no more intereſſed in the fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> then the reſt) Veſſells and Vaſſalls of wrath, and thrall to eternall perdition: And thus may we Catholikes haue no leſſe reaſon to admire the inſcrutable Wiſdome, and Goodneſſe of the ſaid diuine Maieſty, if we enter into conſideration of diuers Articles of Faith, taught by the Catholike Church, and belieued by her obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; to ſee how far ſome of them are eſtranged from all humane Prudence, and how far diſcoſted others do lye from the reach of Mans capacity. And to particularize this in ſome Examples, we find, that anſwerably hereto it was our Sauiours good pleaſure among all the Apoſtles to inſtitute him, as Head of the reſt, who openly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke his Lord and Maiſter, and after increaſed his ſinne of Abnegation, with the aggrauating circumſtance of Periury: So as <hi>Ieſus</hi> thought it beſt in the abyſſmall depth of his Wiſdome, to build the Confeſſion of Faith vpon the deniall of Faith, and to appoint him, who diſclaimed in Chriſt, to be the future Anchor and ſtay of all thoſe, who ſhould after truſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort the Sacraments (which are ordained to be certaine conduits, &amp; paſſages, wherby to deryue into Mans ſoule Gods grace) do conſiſt of externall ſignes, or formes, wherein the ſtupendious wonder is (though I grant <note n="c" place="margin">

For ſome of them do teach, that the Sacraments, are <hi>Cauſae morales</hi> of our Iuſtification, euen as he is the true cauſe of a Mans death, who comaundeth the Man to be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though himſelfe do not touch the Man.

But the Heauens are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the Elements.</note> hauing either heate or life.</p>
                  <p>But now if we turne our Pen more particulerly to the moſt Bleſſed, &amp; Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> (where the Word being made Fleſh, by his Word, made Bread Fleſh) we ſhalbe able to diſcouer whole ſeas of wonders, and be forced to acknowledge, that Mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is not of force to ſound them, or that it beſt apprehendeth them, in not apprehending them (ſtill bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an obſequious, and inuolued beliefe of what Gods Church teacheth therin) no otherwiſe then the Memory often ſerues to remember, that ſome things it did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing it is my intended Method to ſpend this firſt Part in explicating, and vnfoulding our Aduerſaries greateſt, and ſtrongeſt difficulties which they vſe, as ſo many <hi>Arietes,</hi> or Engines, to ruinate and batter downe the walles of the ancient Catholike doctrine therin: All which though they ſhalbe fully reconciled, &amp; explaned, ſo as our vnderſtanding ſhalbe conuinced of the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity therof (and conſequently that Chriſt was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite his Body truly, and really vnder the formes of Bread, and wine) yet neuertheleſſe the externall betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſe (the alluring Eue, entiſing our Vnderſtanding, the proper ſeate of Faith, to giue aſſent to it owne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) will ſtill be whiſpering in our eares the contrary doctrine. Therfore I haue thought good to premoniſh the Reader in the entrance hereof, that in this Myſtery he is to relinquiſh all entercourſe with Senſe, &amp; to ſtand in hoſtility with the ſame, yea euen forcing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning his Vnderſtanding to receaue no intelligence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13333:19"/> from thence; and euer to remember, that he who firſt made the Eye, ſtill retaines a commaund ouer the Eye. Thus violence, only in enioying of him, who forbiddeth all violence, is warrantable (for not only touching life, but faith alſo) <note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p>But before we vndertake to ſhew the poſſibility of all ſuch points, as are found in this Myſtery of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, it will much conduce (I ſuppoſe) to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proiect, if we lay downe the graue iudgments of the learned, concerning what things be factible, or may be done by God, and what things may ſeeme to tranſcend his might, who in might tranſcendeth all things: fince ſo the impartiall Reader may the better obſerue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the acknowledged doubts in the Euchariſt imply in themſelues any abſolute impoſſibility, or no.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then it is generally agreed vpon by the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that God is able to do euery thing, which Mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is able to conceaue. The reaſon hereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that fince the Obiect of our mind is <hi>Ens,</hi> and <hi>Verum</hi> in generall, and that which may be conceaued or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, may really &amp; truly exiſt: Therfore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that God can effect all that, which Man is able to conceaue in his Mind.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Learned (eſpecially thoſe which are Chriſtians) affirme, that not only thoſe things, which Man is able to apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his mind, but alſo many other things incomprehenſible in Mans vnderſtanding, God can effect. For ſeeing (ſay they) that <hi>totum Ens</hi> of it ſelfe is intelligible, and to be conceaued, and that which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13333:21"/> is <hi>non Ens</hi> cannot be conceaued; neuertheleſſe our Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding through it weakneſſe, and imbecillity (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be cleared with the Light of Grace) is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceauing of things, &amp; ſuppoſeth many things cannot exiſt, or be (and conſequently not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our Vnderſtanding, or in themſelues to be factible) which may indeed exiſt, and ſo become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of our Mind. Thus our Vnderſtanding may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that ſome things there are, which it cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: neuertheleſſe the more the vnderſtanding doth lift it ſelfe vp towards God, the more it is illuminated, and the better refined for the penetrating of any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; no otherwiſe then a vapour the higher it is eleuated vp by the Sunne, the more cleare, and purified it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes. This doctrine of theirs, as it is warrantable in the Authority of Gods ſacred word, ſo is it iuſtifiable in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers exemplified Articles of our Faith, which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers eſteemed, as things impoſſible, and by deniall therof aſcribed vnto God, only a kind of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Omnipotency.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they teach, that God hath in all things ſo much an <hi>Actiue Power,</hi> by how much they haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a <hi>Paſsiue Power:</hi> And in this ſenſe perhaps the Heathen Philoſophers acknowledged Gods Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But their Errour was, in that they thought, that the <hi>Actiue Power</hi> of God could not extend beyond the <hi>Paſsiue Power</hi> of things (thus we ſee it verified in theſe learned men, <note n="e" place="margin">

                     <hi>That the world through wiſdome knew not God)</hi> wheras all Chriſtian Philoſophers do teach the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: and therfore they belieue, that God could, &amp; did create the world of <hi>Nothing.</hi> Now to make a thing of <hi>Nothing,</hi> is not to depend, and rely in any ſort of the <hi>Paſsiue Power</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:13333:21"/> of the Subiect, ſince in this kind of producing there was no preexiſtent ſubiect at all, much leſſe any Paſſiue power thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they further proceed, and affirme, that God can doe all things, which can by any meanes exiſt, agreeably to that of our Sauiour, <hi>Omnia</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">

                     <hi>tibi poſsibilia ſunt:</hi> Now all that may exiſt, which in it owne nature implyeth a Being only, and not a Not-being And from hence proceedeth that common Axiome of Deuines: <hi>That euery thing is poſsible to God to be done, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth not a contradiction:</hi> Now what implyeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, is impoſſible to be done. And the reaſon heerof is in that, what implyeth a contradiction ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a <hi>Being,</hi> and a <hi>Not-being</hi> of a thing, and all this at one time: and therfore if ſuch a thing could be, then could a thing be, whoſe <hi>Being</hi> ſhould conſiſt in a <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being.</hi> Now only that, which hath no Being cannot be effected by God; ſince euery thing that is, ought in ſome ſort to be like to him, of whome it is. Beſides to make that which is not, and hath no Being, is not to make, but rather a <hi>Not-making,</hi> to the which, not any Power, but an Impotency belongeth; which Impotency can in no ſort be aſſigned to his Diuine Maieſty, who only is weak, in not being able to be weake. Thus is his mighty Arme ſhortened in deficiency, but extended in ſtrength, ſince to him it is more eaſy to do, then not to do. And thus we teach, that he is not able to make <hi>Nothing,</hi> who yet of <hi>Nothing</hi> made all things. And therfore anſwerably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (becauſe God is not capable of any defect) we ſay, God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not dye, becauſe <hi>Death</hi> is formally <hi>non Ens</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that true Diuinity is impatible.) By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we affirme, that God cannot ſinne, ſince the power
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13333:22"/> required to <hi>Sinne,</hi> is only a want of Power, though po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully raigning in Man. So free is he from all ſuch weakneſſe, ſince he ſheweth himſelfe moſt Omnipotent, in being herein not Omnipotent.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of theſe foure points, which are (as it were) foure graduall ſteps, wherby Mans Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may climbe vp, to ſee how far Gods Power may extend it ſelfe; or ſo many high Turrets (from whence our ſoule, ouerlooking the low, and beaten paths of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) may with an inward reflexe view the boundleſſe, and vaſt heights of Gods infinite Might, and Puiſſance: The vſe wherof is, that the Reader may make application of this doctrine to the difficulties of the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo ſee, if any of them (according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules) may imply any Impoſſibility, or noe. For though we graunt, that many things therin do tranſcend the created courſe of Nature; yet neuertheleſſe, God (who is Natures <hi>Nature)</hi> is able at his pleaſure to diſioint the ſetled frame therof; and therfore heere appeareth the great Indignity, which theſe Idolaters of Nature (I mean the Sectaries of this Tyme, who impugne the doctrine of the Euchariſt, namely, becauſe it is repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Reaſon) do offer vnto God, in ſeeking to confine his force within the narrow lymits of Nature; as if the precincts therof were the <hi>Herculean Pillar,</hi> beyond which his Omnipotency (which is only bounded within a boundleſſe compaſſe) cannot paſſe: So apt theſe Men are to breath out blaſphemies againſt him, through whome they breath, &amp; to ſpeake in diſhonour of him, in whome they ſpeake.</p>

                  <p>But now ſince in an erring and miſtaking Eye, they may appeare meere Repugnances, I haue thought good therefore (once more, this ſecond tyme) to forwarne our Aduerſaryes (for their former ſleights with other Mens labours do preſage their like dealing heerin, if full preuention and caution be not made afore) that they do not diuulge to their followers (leſſe capable of ſuch nice ſpeculations) the bare difficultyes alone, as here they lye, concealing their Explications drawne from Philoſophy and Diuinity, and ſo traducing vs (though moſt falſly) as mantayners of moſt euident and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable contradictoryes: but that they would vouchſafe withall to take notice of their Marginall illuſtrations; and ſo either to relate them both together, or to paſſe them ouer togeather, ſince this deportment is beſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the candor &amp; integrity of an ingenuous and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning Aduerſary.</p>

But heere the <hi>Materia prima</hi> of Bread and wyne doth not remaine, and therefore the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> teacheth, that the Conuerſion is made of the whole ſubſtance of Bread, and wyne, meaning thereby both of the matter, and forme thereof.</note> remaining, nor any other thing <note n="c" place="margin">

And in this ſenſe diuers ancient Fathers doe write, that the Body of Chriſt is made of Bread: <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith <hi>Serm. de Coena Domini: Panis iſte, quem Dominus Diſcipulis porrigebat, non effigie, ſed natura mutatus, omnipotentia Dei factus eſt caro.] Gaudentius</hi> tract. 2. de Exodo. <hi>Ipſe naturarum Creator, &amp; Dominus, qui producit de terra panem, de pane rurſus, quia &amp; poteſt, &amp; promiſit, efficit proprium corpus: &amp; qui de aqua vinum fecit, de vino ſanguinem ſuum facit.]</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cited by <hi>S.

                        <hi>Not without Bloud.]</hi> The reaſon hereof is, becauſe Chriſt is there whole vnder either of the externall formes, in regard of the naturall vnion of his ſoule with his Body, which vnion is neuer more to be diſſolued, ſince he is neuer more to die. But if his Body ſhould be without Bloud, then ſhould it be a dead Body, and conſequently himſelfe were hereafter to die againe, contrary to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Chriſtus reſurgens ex inortuis, iam non moritur: mors illi vltra non dominabitur.</hi>
                     </note> not without Bloud. In like ſort by the ſame vertue, the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Chriſt is only intended, and yet <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>His Diuinity.]</hi> The Humanity of Chriſt is euer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Diuinity, and therfore his Humanity being in the Sacrament by force of Conſecration, his Diuinity is alſo there with it <hi>per concomitantiam,</hi> as the Deuines do ſpeake. Now, that where the Body of Chriſt is, there the Diuinity of Chriſt muſt be alſo, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from this Principle of Faith: to witt, That Chriſt is one diuine Perſon ſubſiſting in two natures, and therefore whereſoeuer the Body of Chriſt is, it can haue no other then a diuine ſubſiſtence, which ſubſiſtence is the ſame in matter with the diuine Eſſence. So as we ſee by force of the <hi>Hypoſtaticall vnion</hi> (which is neuer to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) where the Body of Chriſt is, there the Diuinity is alſo.</note> his <hi>Diuinity,</hi> which is euer <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>In all places.]</hi> If the Diuinity of God were not in all places, then ſhould it be circumſcriptible, or at leaſt, definitiue in place, and conſequently not Infinite; &amp; then it were no true Diuinity.</note> in all places, is <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heere of new.]</hi> In like ſort all do grant, that the Diuinity of Chriſt was in the wombe of the B. Virgin before her Conception; and yet the Diuinity was there (after another manner) at the tyme of her Conception.</note> heere of new, truly, and really exhibited.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Repreſented.]</hi> It may be ſaid to be repreſented. Firſt, becauſe the externall formes of Bread, and wyne doe repreſent the Body of Chriſt, as it dyed vpon the Croſſe; and the Bloud, as it was ſhed vpon the croſſe; for the Euchariſt is a commemoration of the Paſſion of Chriſt, according to thoſe words of <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 11. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Domini annunciabitis, donec veniat.</hi> And in this reſpect his Body may be ſaid to be repreſented in the Euchariſt, becauſe it is not there after the ſame manner, as it was vpon the Croſſe, but only by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; and in this ſenſe <hi>Auguſtine epiſt.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bonifacium,</hi> is to be vnderſtood, where he ſaith: <hi>Secundum quemdam modum, Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Corporis Chriſti, Corpus Chriſti eſt.</hi> Secondly it is ſaid to be repreſented, or in figure, becauſe the externall formes of Bread, and wyne, are the ſignes of the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt there preſent, though veyled ouer with thoſe formes.

                        <hi>Chriſts Bloud.]</hi> As the Bloud of Chriſt is taken for that Bloud which was in the Chalice vnder the externall ſpecies of wine, ſo it is a Sacrament, and conſequently a Will, or Teſtament. But as his Bloud is taken for that Bloud, which was ſhed vpon the Croſſe: ſo is his Teſtament ſealed, and eſtabliſhed in the ſame Bloud. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to this double acception of Chriſts Bloud, we find, that S. Luke did ſpeake in theſe words: <hi>Hic Calix nouum Teſtamentum in ſanguine meo,</hi> where by the word <hi>Calix,</hi> is meant Bloud, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Teſtament.</note> Bloud, was yet ſealed in his Bloud.</p>

                        <hi>Externall Formes.]</hi> We hold, that when the Externall Species are corrupted, the ſame ſubſtantiall Forme ſucceeds, which would naturally haue ſucceeded, if the Bread, and Wine had not bene changed into the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt. And yet we teach not, that this commeth by any <hi>Generation,</hi> for in euery <hi>Generation</hi> there is <hi>eadem materia numero</hi> vnder both the <hi>Termini,</hi> or Formes, which heere is not; for the ſame <hi>Materia prima</hi> which was in the Body of Chriſt, is not in the new introduced forme. Now then, though it doth not proceed from any preexiſtent Matter, yet it cannot be ſaid to be Created: for <hi>Creation</hi> properly hath no reference, or relation (as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding meerly of <hi>Nothing)</hi> to any former thing whatſoeuer; but heere this new forme hath a neceſſary relation, and dependency of the corruption of the former ſpecies of bread, and wine; for if the ſaid formes were not, and after became not corrupted, this new ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme would not ſucceed. Laſtly we teach, that this new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is ſubſtituted, or brought in by God, euen in that very Inſtant, when the Formes of Bread, and Wine ceaſe to be. And this neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is not accompliſhed by any ſecond and new Miracle: for euen as when the matter of a Mans Bodie being ſufficiently diſpoſed, God doth immediately create and infuſe the ſoule, and yet this is not called a Miracle, becauſe the order of things already ſet downe by God, doth require it. In like ſort, when the alteration of the ſpecies of Bread, &amp; Wine is proceeded ſo far, that then are made preſent requiſite diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions (as the courſe of things requires) to introduce ſome forme, then doth God in that very inſtant miniſter the matter, and ſo the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme is introduced. Now heere we are to note, that when any part of theſe formes are corrupted, the Body of Chriſt either in whole, or in part is not extinct therby, but only ceaſeth to be vnder thoſe corrupted formes, ſtill continuing whole vnder the reſt not corrupted, and if all the formes be corrupted, then it ceaſeth to be there at all, not much otherwiſe, then when a Mans Leg is cut off, the ſoule which was in the Leg, dyeth not (for if it dyed, then he who wanted a leg, ſhould want a part of his ſoule) but only ceaſeth to informe that part, informing all the reſt: and if all parts of the Body were diſioynted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, then the Soule not dying, ceaſeth only to informe any of the ſaid parts.</note> externall Formes being corrupted, a new ſubſtantiall Forme is introduced, and yet heere is no Generation; it is not produced out of any preexiſtent Matter, and yet no Creation; it is exhibited immediately, and only by God, and yet without any new Miracle.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, <hi>A Change</hi> (ſee heere repoſe in Motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) wrought without Change, ſince the Body of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffered no alteration therby; for it <note n="r" place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT let vs paſſe on to the difficulties of another nature. We find, that Chriſts Body by force of thoſe operatiue words, is in diuers places, &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at one, and the ſame time: for though Chriſt be incircumſcriptibly in the Sacrament, yet we teach, that as a Body by Gods power may want all <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>VVant all Circumſcription.]</hi> See the explication of this difficulty hereafter in the next Paſſage at the letter D</note> Circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; ſo by the ſame power it may haue diuers <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>Diuers Circumſcriptions.]</hi> A Body may by Gods Power haue at one time diuers Circumſcriptions; which is, to haue ſeuerall places extenſiuely. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe that only implies a contradiction (and conſequently, as we touched afore, cannot be done by God) which impugnes the very eſſence of a thing, ſo as it doth preſuppoſe a Being, and a Not-Being of the ſaid thing. But to be in place, or in diuers places at once, is extrinſecall, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and not of the Eſſence; but what is extrinſecall, or Accidentary, is <hi>poſterius,</hi> and later then the thing it ſelfe, and conſequently by Gods Omnipotency may be deuided from the nature, and eſſence thereof. The proofe of this doctrine is alſo deduced from the example of our Sauiour, who neuer leauing Heauen, appeared to <hi>S. Paul</hi> vpon the Earth, as we read <hi>Act. c.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. That it was not any voice (which ſpake to him) made by Gods Power, or the miniſtery of the Angells only (as ſome doe anſwere) but our Sauiour himſelfe, appeareth: both becauſe mention being made hereof in diuers places of the Actes, it euer toucheth <hi>Pauls</hi> ſeeing of Chriſt in his owne Perſon. So we read <hi>Act. c.</hi> 22. That <hi>Ananias</hi> put <hi>Paul</hi> in remembrance of his ſeeing of Chriſt. In like ſort c. 26. Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, That he appeared to him, thereby to make him a witneſſe of the things, which he ſaw, but he could not be a witneſſe thereof (eſpecially of the Reſurrection) except he had truly, and really ſeene the very Body of Chriſt. And anſwerably hereto we read, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. after he had recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuers, who had ſeene our Sauiour after his Reſurrection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in the end with theſe words: <hi>Nouiſſimè tamquam abortiuo viſus eſt mihi,</hi> which ſaying of his had beene falſe, except he had ſeene Chriſt himſelfe, ſeeing that the reſt numbred by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> had ſeene him in his owne true, and naturall Body.</p>
                        <p>Neither can it be ſaid (as ſome others would haue it) that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw Chriſt, as he was in Heauen, and not heere vpon the Earth, or in ſome neere place of the aire; and this for diuers reaſons. Firſt becauſe thoſe, that were with <hi>Paul,</hi> did heare a voyce, and ſaw a great light, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. but the Eares, and Eyes of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, could not penetrate ſo farre as Heauen. Secondly, becauſe the light, which appeared to S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, was ſo great, as it almoſt ſtroke him dead for the time; which could not haue had in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſuch force, if it had come ſo farre, as from Heauen. Thirdly, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſeene Chriſt only in Heauen, it might haue beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to him, that he was no true witneſſe of his Reſurrection, and that what he had ſaid to haue ſeene, was only in imagination, and a ſtrong apprehenſion of the Mind.</p>
                        <p>Now our Aduerſaries cannot heere obiect, that if our Sauiour did appeare heere vpon the Earth, or in the Ayre, truly, and really to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that notwithſtanding he was not circumſcriptible in that place for the time, in that he is only circumſcriptible, as he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. This vrgeth nothing: For, for a Body to be circumſcriptible in a place, it is not required, that it ſhould not be circumſcriptible in no place alſo, but only it is required, that it ſhould be truly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured with that place; ſo as the <hi>Termini</hi> of the Place, and the Body be anſwerable the one to the other.</p>
                     </note> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptions; much more then may it be at once in diuers places Sacramentally, ſince <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vnity of Eſſence.]</hi> The eſſentiall vnity of a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes not of the vnity of Place, ſeeing a thing is one, before it hath one place: ſo as to be in place is but ſubſequent, and acceſſory to the nature of any body; but it dependes of the internall principles of the ſaid thing.</note> Vnity of Eſſence, and Nature is not diſſolued by diuerſity of place. Hence is it, that it may be neere <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <hi>Neere to the Earth.]</hi> The ſame Body in ſeuerall places may be neere to the ground, and far of from the ground. Neither doth this imply any contradiction; for ſeeing, that when a Body is in diuers places, and the relation is terminated to diuers places, it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarliy followeth, that this diuerſe relation is multiplied; for it is to be vnderſtood, that thoſe contrary relations are in one, and the ſame ſubiect <hi>per diuerſa fundamenta,</hi> to wit, in a different reſpect of ſeuerall places; which diuerſity of reſpect taketh away all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the thing it ſelfe.</note> to the Earth, and remote from the ſame; moued, and not moued; remaining vpon the Altar, and receaued by the Communicant, and all at one, and the ſame time. And yet if the ſame Body (ſuppoſing it were patible) be in one place wounded, it would alſo be found <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Remaine wounded.]</hi> For thoſe things, which are receaued in the Body it ſelfe (be they eyther Actions or Qualities) are not mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied<hi>:</hi> And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Body is but one, and not many, or diuers: And being but one, it can but haue <hi>vnum eſſe Subſtantiale,</hi> though diuers <hi>eſſe Localia,</hi> as the School-men do ſpeake, who therupon teach, that all thoſe relations, and actions, which are terminated <hi>ad Loca,</hi> to the diuerſity of places, are multiplied, becauſe they follow, and depend vpon <hi>eſſe Locale:</hi> but ſuch Actions, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as are receaued within the body placed, are not multiplied, becauſe they follow <hi>eſſe Subſtantiale.</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13333:28"/> keeps her certaine bounds, euen in tranſgreſſing her bounds.</p>
                  <p>Thus anſwerably hereto we teach, that it may be in a place, where afore it was not; and yet neither through any Locall <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Locall Motion.]</hi> The Body of Chriſt is in a place, where before it was not; and this neither by any Locall Motion, or new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of it, but by a true Conuerſion of the Bread into the Body; not much vnlike vnto the new being of the Soule in the Matter, or Subſtance, which is added to Mans Body by nutrition, where we ſee the Soule to be in that part, not by any Locall Motion, nor Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soule, but only by informing that part newly adioyned to the Body, which afore it did not informe.</note> motion (for it neuer leaueth Heauen) nor by any Generation, for afore it was. It is not <note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Not continued]</hi> The Body of our Sauiour, as it is in the hands of the Prieſt, cannot be ſaid to be continued with the ſame Body, as it is in Heauen, nor yet to be deuided from the ſame, ſeeing thoſe things only, which are many and diuers (whether they be <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> or <hi>Partes)</hi> are capable of continuation, or diuiſion: Now, Chriſts Body (as it is in Heauen) and in the Prieſts hands, is not two ſeuerall entire things, neither ſeuerall parts therof, but only one whole, and entire Body. And though there be a great diſtance of place, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of many other Bodies betweene Chriſts Body in Heauen, and vpon the Altar; this only proueth, that thoſe places, to wit, Heauen, and the Earth, are diſcontinued, and deuided one from the other; and that Chriſts Body is deuided from it ſelfe, in reſpect of ſuch diuerſitie of place, but not in reſpect of it proper ſubſtance.</note> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with the ſame Body, being in another place, nor yet diſcontinued, or deuided from the ſame; and yet neither is the Body multiplied, or doubled, nor the places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.

And when we reply, that we teach that Chriſt neuer leaueth Heauen, but is both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and vpon the Altar; then they ignorantly obiect, that for a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be in Heauen, and vpon the Altar at one time, is a meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and conſequently impoſſible. But this is groſſe Ignorance, for, for to be in Heauen, and not in Heauen, or vpon the earth, and not vpon the earth at one, and the ſame time, is a flat contradiction, and conſequently cannot be performed by God. But to be in Heauen and vpon the earth at one time, is no more a Contradiction, then the ſoule to be at once, both in the Head, and the foote.</note> Heauen; and euen then it enioyeth a perfect <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <p>Now heere we are to note, that the difficulties in this Paſſage ſway much the iudgements of our ſenſible, and materiall Chriſtians (for ſo I may well ſtyle them, ſince they meaſure their faith by the <hi>Lesbian Square</hi> of their Senſe.) And therefore in regard thereof, I haue thought good, in two or three ſubſequent Chapters, (ſepoſed only to this end) to exemplify the ſaid difficulty of multiplicity of places, in other points acknowledged, and confeſſed by our Aduerſaries. Wherefore I could wiſh, that when they doe looke vpon the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, they would ſhut the Eye of Senſe, and Naturall Reaſon; ſince ſo they might (no doubt) by ſeeing the leſſe, be able to ſee the more; and be like herein to that great Apoſtle, who by looſing his Eyes, obtained Light. <note place="bottom">(q) <hi>Eutiches Hereſy.]</hi> The Hereſy of <hi>Eutiches</hi> (beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points) was, that the Fleſh of Chriſt was not of the ſame nature with ours.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OVV to aſcend to the laſt Mount of difficulties in this miraculous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elementation: We are to obſerue, that though the Body of Chriſt be heere indued with Life, yet it is not <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Not obiectiuely ſenſible.]</hi> That is, that the externall ſenſe of another cannot apprehend it to haue life. Now, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doe generally teach, that (in regard of the peculiar manner of the exiſtence of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt) <hi>Adiectiues,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a neceſſary reference <hi>ad Corpora circumſtantia,</hi> do not predicate of his Body, as it is in the Euchariſt, though they may be ſaid of it, as it is in heauen. The reaſon hereof being, in that the Body of Chriſt is vnder the formes of bread, and wine, without any reference, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or order <hi>ad Corpora circumſtantia.</hi> And therefore though his Body, as it is in the Sacrament be a naturall, and corporall ſubſtance, indued with life, ſenſe, and colour; yet it is not there tangible, ſenſible, or viſible &amp;c. becauſe to be actually tangible, ſenſible, or viſible, implieth a reference <hi>ad Corpora circumſtantia,</hi> in whoſe ſenſes, and eyes the Body is ſo to appeare.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiuely ſenſible; though it be a true corporall Subſtance, it is not tangible; and though it be coloured, it is not viſible. In <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>In like ſort we teach.]</hi> Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt hath eyes, and eares, becauſe it is there a true, and perfect body, which it could not be, except it were organized with thoſe parts. And yet thoſe organs of Senſe do not exerciſe in the Euchariſt (as they are in the Euchariſt) theſe facultyes (as the Eye to ſee, the eare to heare.) The reaſon hereof is that, which was touched afore, to wit, that not only <hi>Adiectiues</hi> which haue relation <hi>ad Corpora circumſtantia,</hi> but alſo <hi>Verbes,</hi> which imply a preſence of his Body in the Euchariſt with reference <hi>ad Corpora circumſtantia,</hi> do not predicate of his Body, as it is in the Euchariſt, in regard of his ſpirituall, and peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exiſting there, though they do predicate of it, as it is in heauen. Now to ſee, to heare &amp;c, beares a neceſſary reference <hi>ad Corpora cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantia,</hi> to wit to the externall obiect of the Eye, and to the ſound cauſed by ſome body &amp;c. Notwithſtanding Chriſt in the Euchariſt may be ſaid to ſee, to heare &amp;c. and this for a double reaſon. Firſt, becauſe it is there the ſaid body, which it is in heauen, but his body in Heauen ſeeth, heareth &amp;c. therefore his Body in the Sacrament doth ſee, and heare, though not <hi>quatenus eſt in Sacramento.</hi> A ſecond Reaſon may be, in that as his body is in the Sacrament, ſo it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Diuinity, in the fruition whereof the Humanity ſeeth, and heareth all things. And in theſe two reſpectes the ancient Fathers (according to that ſaying of S. <hi>Baſil: Verba Inuocationis &amp;c. quis Sanctorum ſcripto nobis reliquit?</hi> c. 27. lib. de Sp. ſancto:) as alſo the Prieſt in thoſe words, <hi>Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miſerere nobis,</hi> did, and doth daily pray vnto Chriſt, as he is in the Euchariſt, as being moſt confident, that he doth there heare him.</note> like ſort we teach, that it heere performing the operations of Senſe, and enioying the organs of Senſe, doth yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them without the help of thoſe ſaid organs. We heere alſo find Quantity without <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>VVithout Diuiſion.]</hi> The Body of Chriſt as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe, hath a true quantity, and conſequently it is diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but yet in regard, that it exiſteth in the Euchariſt after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a ſpirit, and not of a naturall body, as being exempted from all extenſion of place (for it is whole in euery part) therefore it may in this ſenſe be ſaid, that it is not diuiſible.</note> Diuiſion, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude without <note n="d" place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>Magnitude without place.]</hi> Moſt of the difficulties in this Chapter are ſolued, by knowing, what is of the eſſence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude, or Quantity, and what not, therefore I will inſiſt the longer in ſetting downe the iudgements of the beſt learned herein. The Philoſophers then doe aſſigne three things to concurre to Magnitude, of which the one euer cauſeth the other.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt of theſe three is, that euery Magnitude ſhould haue an extenſion in it ſelfe, and haue <hi>Partem extra Partem,</hi> that is, that one Part ſhould not be confounded in it ſelfe with another Part, and conſequently an intrinſecall ſite, and diſpoſition of parts. And this is of the very eſſence of euery Magnitude, and cannot be ſeparated from the ſame. Thus we ſay, that a <hi>Body</hi> is an extenſion in <hi>Longitude, Latitude,</hi> and <hi>Profunditie: Superficies</hi> an extenſion in <hi>Longitude,</hi> and <hi>Latitude; A Line</hi> an extenſion in <hi>Longitude</hi> only. So as extenſion euer preſuppoſeth different parts of the body, and conſequently a Body cannot want extenſion.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing agreeing to euery Magnitude, is, to haue a commenſuration, or coextenſion with place, that is, an extrinſecall diſpoſition, and order of Parts according to Place. And this ſecond ariſeth from the firſt, and conſequently as being later in nature, then the firſt, may by Gods Power, be ſeparated from the ſame, yea it is actually ſeparated from the firſt in the higheſt Sphere, which being a true Body, hath true Magnitude, and <hi>Partem extra Partem,</hi> and yet it hath not any Coextenſion, or Commenſuration with place, for it is in no Place. In like ſort, if God before the Creation of the world, had created a Man, or a ſtone &amp;c. this Man or ſtone would haue had <hi>Partem extra Partem,</hi> and yet without any coextenſion or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration with Place.</p>
                        <p>The third, and laſt property of Magnitude, is, to extrude, and driue away all other Magnitudes from that place, which is made equall, and commenſurable to it ſelfe, that is, not to ſuffer another Magnitude to be in the ſame place with it. Now, as the ſecond was later, and proceded from the firſt, ſo this third reſulteth out of the ſecond, and is later then the ſame in nature: So anſwerably hereto we ſee, that the reaſon why one Magnitude doth not ſuffer another to be in the ſame place, is, becauſe it doth poſſeſſe all the place it ſelfe. But now ſeeing, that the later depends on the firſter, and not the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the later, therfore we do hould, that <hi>Diuinâ potentiâ</hi> it may be effected, that a Body may poſſeſſe, and occupy a place, and yet not expell another from the ſame. And this is that, which we call <hi>penetration of bodies,</hi> ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>mpugned by our Proteſtant Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. Now according to this doctrine (which is deliuered by all our beſt Philoſophers) we hould, that Chriſts Body in the Sacrament hath the true, and whole Magnitude of his body. But this Magnitude hath there only the firſt condition, which is eſſentiall to euery Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (to wit, to be extended in it ſelfe, and by reaſon of that intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall extenſion, to haue <hi>Partem extra Partem)</hi> but it hath not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond condition (much leſſe the third) for it is not coextended with any place, ſince though it haue true Quantity, yet it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menſurable with any place, but exiſteth whole (in reſpect of all externall place) in euery part. And thus what is aſſigned in this Paſſage to our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Body in the Sacrament, which ſeemes to be common to euery naturall body, it is to be vnderſtood (according to the firſt condition of Magnitude) of the extenſion of the body in it ſelfe, and intrinſecall diſpoſition of it parts without any reference to Place. But what is heer denyed to the ſaid body, as it exiſteth in the Sacrament, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to euery other naturall body, that is meant of it (according to the ſecond, or third condition) only in reſpect of externall extenſion of parts, and outward commenſuration with place, which heere it wanteth. And this may ſuffice for this Point, where by the true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, moſt (if not all) of the doubts of this Paſſage may be anſwered; and therfore they will only need a ſhort application hereof for their full Illuſtration.</p>
                     </note> Place, a Body without <note n="e" place="margin">

So as we heere find Contiguity in <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Contiguitie in diſtance.]</hi> viz. In the different reſpect of the inward ſite, or diſpoſition of parts, and the outward coextenſion of place.</note> diſtance, Confuſion (as I may ſay) in diſtinction, and a ioyning togeather in ſeparation. My meaning is,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13333:32"/> that Chriſts Body, though hauing Quantity, yet doth heere exiſt, as if it were without <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>VVithout Quantity.]</hi> Becauſe it wanteth the ſecond, and third condition of Magnitude aboue mentioned, which are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to euery Body, as it is naturally in place.</note> Quantity, for the parts therof are receaued in the ſame place, and yet doe not penetrate themſelues. In like ſort his Body hath heere the true quantity, and diſtinction of parts, which it hath in Heauen, and yet it is (without being greater, or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer) wholy contayned within the leaſt part of a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Hoaſt. Thus we ſee, that though a <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Though a Spirit.]</hi> A Spirit cannot be extended in place, becauſe it hath not any extenſion of Parts at all, &amp; therfore it is indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for ſeeing, to be extended in place is a formall effect, proceeding from it formall cauſe of Extenſion in it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if therfore a Spirit ſhould be extended in place, we ſhould admit the formall Effect without the formall Cauſe, which cannot be, ſince the formall Effect is later in nature, then the Cauſe, and cannot be without the Cauſe, though the formall Cauſe may be without the Effect, as we ſay heere; that the inward Extenſion of Chriſts Body doth want (by Gods power) all extenſion of place.</note> Spirit (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Gods Omnipotency) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be extended in place, yet that a Body may want all ſuch extenſion. And thus anſwerably heereto we teach, that this ſacred Body is whole in euery part, and yet hath a true diſtinction of Parts. And ſo though the externall formes be broken, or diſparted in themſelues; yet the Body lying vnder them, remaines in the leaſt parcell therof, entire, and vndeui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as we ſee that when a looking-glaſſe is broken, a mans whole face will appeare in euery parcell thereof. Briefely we hould, that in this ſtupendious Myſterie, that Chriſts Body remaining a Body, &amp; not a Spirit, yet doth exiſt as a <note n="l" place="margin">
                        <hi>Exiſt as a Spirit.]</hi> viz. As not hauing any Coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with place, no more then a Spirit.</note> Spirit, and not as a Body: ſo as we may well terme it in a ſober conſtruction a Body <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Spiritualized.]</hi> Not that the Body by this meanes is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Spirit, for that is falſe: Nor that ſtill remaining a Body, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a Spirit, for that is impoſſible: Nor that the Body of Chriſt is in the Euchariſt only Spiritually, as the word <hi>Spiritually</hi> in our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries conſtruction is oppoſed againſt the words <hi>Truly, or Really:</hi> But it may be ſaid to be <hi>ſpiritualized,</hi> becauſe (as it is often ſaid) it exiſteth in the Euchariſt like a Spirit, to wit, without any extenſion of place, but being (in reſpect of all ſuch extenſion) whole in euery part.</note> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized.</p>
                  <p>Theſe (loe) alledged, and at large in the margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall References ſolued, are the chiefeſt Myſteries, and difficulties, which are produced in the doctrine of the Real Preſence. And heere I am to aduertiſe the Reader of two things: the one, that the moſt (if not all) of theſe obſcurities were firſt through an inceſſant agitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind diſcouered by our Catholike <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>Catholike Schoole-men.]</hi> For theſe, and ſuch like are handled, and diſcuſſed by <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas, The Maiſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, Scotus, Suarez, Vaſquez,</hi> and diuers others.</note> School-men for the more exact ſearch of the truth, and after moſt fully anſwered by them; ſo as theſe ſhort currents of doubts, from thence receaued their ſtops, from whence they firſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13333:32"/> did ſpring. But now our Aduerſaries (for it is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of learning, euer to be wounded by her owne hand) are not aſhamed euen to turne the edges of thoſe Arguments (firſt propounded, and anſwered by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Deuines, vpon vs, who maintayne the ſaid faith which thoſe Doctours did. By which courſe of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we may eaſily diſcouer, how barren, &amp; dry our Sectaries are, for they bring little, or nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to impugne our faith heerin, but only Eccho forth what they haue heard our learned Catholikes afore ſpeak; yet do they Eccho after a ſtrange manner, for they do not repeate the laſt words (as in nature, and reaſon they ſhould) but this were for their diſaduantage, ſince they containe the anſwers, and ſolutions; but only the firſter part thereof, wherin do lye the obiections.</p>
                  <p>The other point, wherof the Reader is to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, is this: That moſt of the former difficulties (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the two latter Paſſages, or Chapters) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the repugnancy, which they beare to the outward Senſe, and therfore ſeeing, that theſe are chiefly inſiſted vpon, and more &amp; more reinforced by our Aduerſaries, we may heere truly ſay, that no ſmall part of a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries Faith lyes in his eye. Thus howſoeuer ſuch rapt Spiritualiſts will at other times vaunt of their hidden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations from God, concerning the ſecrets of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; yet you ſhall euer find them, euen in the midſt of theſe their aerie, &amp; high-towring Illuminations, to looke downe vpon Senſe and naturall Reaſon (though Reaſon teacheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs not to rely vpon Reaſon in things tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Reaſon) bearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues herein, not much vnlike to your great vnprofitable Kites, which though they fly high, yet they haue their Eye ſtill fixed vpon the earth.</p>

                        <p>A ſixt, is the Obſeruation, how a <hi>Spirit</hi> can be detayned, and holden by a Body; for it ſeemeth no leſſe difficult to be vnderſtood, how a Spirit ſhould be holden by a Body, that it paſſeth not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it would, then that a Body ſhould not be detayned, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by another Body, but that it may freely paſſe through any ſolide bodyes, as if they were no Bodies at all. Now the firſter part of this difficulty appeareth in the former example of the Diuells, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporall Subſtances) are detayned with Hell fire, ſo as that they cannot paſſe whither they would; which point may be alſo exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Soule, which being an immateriall Subſtance, is detey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and holden by our Body.</p>
                        <p>A ſeauenth, may be taken from the Examples out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, where we read, that the Fire by Gods Power did ſuſpend it faculty of heating, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3 And that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> by the ſame Power did walke vpon the waters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. and the like. Now, if God can effect, that, that which is naturally hoate, ſhall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the reaſon, why through diuine power, that which is hoat, ſhall not heate, nor a thing ponderous ſhall not deſcend towards the Center, is, in that <hi>Cauſa eſt prior Effectu,</hi> the cauſe is before it effect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not depending on the effect, may by God be ſeparated from the ſame; but the like reaſon is found in Magnitude, which is the Cauſe, and to fill, or poſſeſſe a place, which is the effect ariſing from the ſaid cauſe, and therefor later in nature then it. Beſides, <hi>Grauitas,</hi> or <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroſity</hi> is not only the cauſe, why a heauy body doth deſcend being out of it naturall place, but it is alſo the cauſe thereof euen in that kind of Cauſe (to wit, <hi>in genere cauſae formalis)</hi> in which, Magnitude is the cauſe, why a Body doth poſſeſſe a place.</p>
                        <p>An eight may be deduced from other Examples in Scripture, whereby is proued, that diuers bodies may poſſeſſe one, and the ſame place, and conſequently, that a Body may want all circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of place. Hereof are no few Examples borrowed from our Sauiour himſelfe, as that of his <hi>Natiuitie,</hi> where our Sauiour did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of the wombe of the Bleſſed Virgin without any breach of the Virginall parts.

For diuers ſuch Paſſages there are, &amp; other Concluſions in Nature, whereunto all Chriſtians giue an abſolute aſſent, and yet their proofes cannot be deduced from the grounds of Naturall Reaſon: ſo true it is, that perfection in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not in this life the portion of Man.

Heere now our Faith teacheth vs (for by the Eagle wings thereof only we do mount ſo high, our Senſe, and naturall Reaſon fluttering ouer neere the ground) that there is one peculiar nature in three different Perſons; ſo as to patterne this to that in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> we find an Vnity, or (as I may tearme it) an Indiuiduality of <hi>Nature,</hi> and a diuerſity of <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſortable to the Vnity of a Body, &amp; multiplicity of places. Now heere we are to know, that euery one of theſe three Perſons is identified really, and formally with this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (the ſtricteſt Vnion that can be conceaued) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Body is only externally conioyned with the place; ſo much is the difficulty of a Body enioying at once diuers locall Circumſcriptions, ſurpaſſed by this dogmaticall Point of one nature being in ſeuerall Perſons without any diſtraction, or multiplication thereof.</p>

Many reaſons hereof I find alledged, but all are inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and conuinced as falſe, euen by the Eye, and experience it ſelfe.</p>

                           <hi>The firſt Reaſon,</hi> is giuen by thoſe, which doe aſſigne the cauſe hereof to be ſome Northern part of the Heauen, to which the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, or Needle euer tendeth, though in ſetting downe, which this part ſhould be, they diſſent. Some doe maintaine, that the Northern Pole of the world, in the Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereunto the ſtone is directed, as <hi>Petrus Peregrinus in tract. de Magnete.</hi> But this ſentence is thus ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, Firſt, becauſe then there ſhould be no variation of the Needle, but that in all places it ſhould directly tend towards the North Pole, which is found by experience, that it doth not. Now, heereby the variation of the Needle is vnderſtood, when the Needle tendeth either Eaſtwardly, or Weſtwardly from the Pole, which in ſeuerall Countries is found more, or leſſe to do. Secondly, if the Pole it ſelfe, were the Point, then the Northern end of the Needle ſhould eleuate it ſelfe towards the Pole with vs heere in <hi>England</hi> (much more in other more <hi>Boreall</hi> Clymates) becauſe to all ſuch places the Pole is eleuated many degrees; but we ſee iuſt contrary hereto, that euen in all theſe Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, the Northern part of the Needle doth depreſſe it ſelfe down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the earth, bending to ſome poynt many degrees vnder the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and conſequently bearing it ſelfe more low, then the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne part thereof. And this depreſſion, of that part is commonly called, the Declination of the Pole of the Loadſtone, or Needle.</p>
                        <p>Others doe teach, the Pole ſtarre to be the point, as <hi>Franciſcus Lopez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hiſt. Occidental. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt by the former reaſon of the afore alledged de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Needle, ſeeing that euen with vs, the Pole ſtarre is euer many degrees aboue our <hi>Horizon.</hi> Secondly, becauſe the Pole ſtarre is euer in motion, and reuolution about the Pole of the world, and maketh it diurnall circle ech way diſtant more then two degrees from the Pole; therefore if this Starre were the cauſe hereof, then ſhould the Needle follow the motion of that ſtarre, and ſo euery houre of the day be in changing it courſe in any one place; which we find, that it doth not at all. Thirdly, becauſe we find, that the Needle in ſome Countries doth vary it motion aboue thirty degrees from the Pole of the world, whereas the furtheſt diſtance of the Pole ſtarre from the Pole it ſelfe (as is ſaid aboue) is not three degrees. Fourthly, becauſe it would follow, that in thoſe Southerne parts, where the Pole ſtarre doth not riſe, the Loadſtone ſhould not turne towards the North, by reaſon that this influence, and vertue of the Pole ſtarre could not penetrate through the earth, and yet in thoſe Auſtrall Countries, the Needle retaineth it former quality: for euen in <hi>Freto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>There are alſo ſome, who aſſigne the cauſe hereofto other ſtarres, and conſtellations neere vnto the Pole, and not to the Pole ſtarre, as <hi>Petrus Gregorius art. intrab. l.</hi> 36. <hi>c.</hi> 7. and <hi>Collegium Conimbricenſe ad</hi> 7. <hi>Phyſic.</hi> 2. but this their error is refuted by all theſe former Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which prooue that the Pole ſtarre is no cauſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>Finally, ſome others will haue ſome point aboue, but <hi>extra Caelum,</hi> to be the reaſon heerof; for they ſay, it cannot be referred to any point of Heauen it ſelfe, ſeeing that euery part therof (the Pole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) is mouable, and yet the needle in any one place, or Countrey neuer changeth it certaine ſite, and reſting. Of this opinion is <hi>Cortes part.</hi> 3. <hi>art. nauig. c.</hi> 5. But this is refelled (beſides by ſome of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alledged Arguments) euen from Philoſophy it ſelfe; for ſeeing there is no Body or Subiect <hi>extra Caelum,</hi> there can no vertue, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence proceed from thence, ſince other wiſe there ſhould be <hi>Accident</hi> originally <hi>fine Subiecto,</hi> which cannot be. Againe that ſuppoſed point ſhould be either moueable, or not moueable if moueable, then ſhould not the Needle in the ſame place alwaies looke, &amp; tend one way if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, then ſhould the Needle in all places reſpect one and the ſame point, but both theſe are falſe.

                        <p>This opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is alſo refelled: Firſt becauſe it would follow from Hence, that a Loadſtone, or Needle ſwimming freely, and without hinderance in the water, ſhould be mouing with change of place euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more forward towards the North, and ſhould not lye ſtill vpon the water, only bearing one end towardes the North<hi>:</hi> but this it doth not.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in that it is found by experience, that in a Port of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Thirdly, becauſe as <hi>Scaliger</hi> well noteth, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 132. the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue force, and vertue of that mountaine of Loadſtone vnder the Pole, ſhould be intercepted, and broken by reaſon of the ſwelling, &amp; roundneſſe of the earth, afore it could could come to other places farre diſtant from this mountaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is moſt improbable to ſay, that this vertue doth penetrate through the earth to Countreys far diſtant; Or if it did, then it would follow, that in Countreys, more or leſſe Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Northren end of the needle ſhould more, or leſſe tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the earth, and vnder the <hi>Horizon:</hi> but no ſuch change of declination is obſerued to be.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, becauſe that wherſoeuer any one do put the Pole of the Loadſtone in reſpect of that Rocke, yet it would follow, that a Needle being placed in the ſame Paralell of this Pole yet diſtant farre from it, ſhould tend directly to the Eaſt, and in other places of the ſame Paralell to the Weſt, but not at all to the North.

                              </gap>ij,</hi> and not much more, then to ſay, The Loadſtone tendeth towards the North, becauſe it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth towards the North<hi>:</hi> yet it is otherwiſe euidently confuted.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, ſeeing there is but one internall, &amp; ſpecificall forme of all Loadſtones, and ſeeing it is obſerued, that, that very part of the Loadſtone doth beare euer towards the North, which was found to lye towards the North in the Mine, or ground, and that all Loadſtones do not lye after one, and the ſame manner in the Mine, the veines, or graine of ſeuerall Loadſtones lying in the Myne ſeuerall wayes; it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followeth, that this peculiar direction towards the North, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſigned to the internall <hi>forme</hi> of the Loadſtone.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the forme of the Loadſtone (as the formes of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compounded bodyes) doth proceed from the mixture of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but we find this vertue, or propenſion of mouing not to be in any of the Elements; How then can they impart it to the Loadſtone?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if the forme ſhould be the cauſe of it direction, then ſhould it (in all probability) be performed by the mediation of ſome vertue or quality of the forme. Now, all qualities cauſed by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Elements, originally proceed <hi>à pain is qualitatibus,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are ſenſible: but this qualitie (if there be any ſuch) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Loadſtone being <hi>Corpus graue,</hi> hath a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion euen from it <hi>forme</hi> to deſcend downward (as we ſee it doth) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot receaue from the ſame <hi>forme</hi> any other kind of motion, for ſo one, and the ſame <hi>forme</hi> ſhould affoard two different motions; which is abſurd to affirme.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, if the proper <hi>forme</hi> ſhould thus moue it ſelfe, then ſhould the ſtone be a liuing creature, for it is only peculiar to a liuing creature locally to moue it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, and laſtly; If there were no variation of the Loadſtone turning it ſelfe towards the North, the cauſe of this motion might with more probability be aſſigned to the forme of the ſtone; but the variation thereof (according to the diuerſity of Countries) is moſt diuers<hi>:</hi> for in ſome places it hath no variation at all; but directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Pole of the world<hi>:</hi> in other partes, to wit, in all the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Maritime places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africke,</hi> from <hi>Norway</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Buona Speranza,</hi> it bendeth more, or leſſe towards the Eaſt from the North Pole: and in all the Orientall Maritime places of the North Parts of <hi>America</hi> from <hi>Terra Florida,</hi> to <hi>Virginia, nuoua Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia &amp;c.</hi> the Needle turneth it end towards the Weſt from the Pole. Now then, ſeeing this irregularity, and diuerſity of variation is ſuch, and ſo great, in ſo much, that in ſome Countries the needle turneth from the Pole thirty degrees, and in other Countries more, or leſſe Eaſtward, or Weſtward: how can it proceed from the internall, and ſpecificall <hi>forme</hi> of the Loadſtone, ſince the forme of euery body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foardes a certainty, and immutability of that motion, which it giueth thereto.</p>
                        <p>And heere now I will end<hi>:</hi> All which I haue produced only to this purpoſe, to ſhew, that the cauſe of the motion of the Loadſtone (though the effect therof be ſubiect to each mans eye) cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be apprehended by Man &amp; that it is Gods pleaſure, either to be the immediate cauſe thereof himſelfe; or at leaſt reſolued to conceale the ſame from vs. Now, if Mans vnderſtanding be not able to penetrate into the cauſes of things ſenſible, materiall, and of what we haue dayly triall; can it be able in the myſterie of the Euchariſt (being a point ſupernaturall, and altogeather remoued from ſenſe) to ſound all the difficulties thereof? Or ſhall it preſume to confine Gods power within thoſe limitts, and bounds, which ſhall be aſſigned as anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the weake proportion, and meaſure of it ſelfe, concluding thus: Mans vnderſtanding cannot conceaue how all thoſe ſeeming impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilityes in the Euchariſt can be ſalued<hi>:</hi> Therefore God cannot effect them. An Illation fitting to proceed from an Atheiſt, or an Heathen Philoſopher, not from a Chriſtian.</p>

But if we ſhould enter into the manner, how it abſolueth this it faculty, we enter into a Labyrinth of intricate ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in regard of the different <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Different Opinions.]</hi> There are two chiefe Opinions touching the manner of ſeeing; The one, they call <hi>Extramittendo,</hi> that is, That the Eye doth ſend forth certayne <hi>Spiritus viſibiles</hi> to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect which the Eye ſeeth, and doe returne backe againe to the Eye with the true forme of the ſaid Obiect. The other is <hi>Intromittendo,</hi> that is, That the <hi>Species,</hi> or formes of the Obiect are ſpherically multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the Aire, or water, and are receaued in at the Eye <hi>per medium Conoidis, viz.</hi> in a Pyramidall manner.</note> opinions deliuered hereof. Thus, that we ſee, it is cleare: but how we ſee (if we belieue diuers) no Man yet cleerly ſeeth.</p>
                  <p>And now to come to that point which may ſeeme in ſome ſort to patterne one of the greateſt obſcurities in the Euchariſt: we find heere (following the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued iudgment of the beſt <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <hi>The beſt Learned.]</hi> The moſt Learned doe for the moſt part hold, that the Eye ſeeth after this ſecond manner, to wit, <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendo.</hi>
                     </note> Learned) that the <hi>Eye</hi> being ſmall in Quantity, is able to containe in it the true proportion of things moſt great, ſince the formes therof multiplyed in the ayre, and ſtill retayning the figure of the true Quantity, are at the laſt receaued in at the <hi>Eye,</hi> there appearing in thoſe perfect dimenſions of breadth,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13333:48"/> and length, which their ſubiects doe truely enioy. And which is more: we ſee by experience, that the <hi>Eye</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcerne the true proportion of a great body in a ſmall glaſſe, or in a point of a Diamond, where it is more wonderfull, becauſe the forme of the ſaid Body entreth into the glaſſe or diamond in a Pyramidall, or Spyre-like point, and yet being multiplied from the glaſſe, to the <hi>Eye,</hi> recouereth againe (as I may ſay) it former Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and ſo is preſented from the glaſſe to the <hi>Eye,</hi> as it was firſt from the ſubiect to the glaſſe: An obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt ſtrange, were it not, that the daily, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſight of any thing is euer the greateſt Enemy to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
                  <p>Now, out of all this I thus inferre; That if naturally the formes of things ſo great, can truly appeare in their owne bignes, in the ſmall compaſſe of a glaſſe, or the Eye; cannot a Body really be in a leſſer place, then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is anſwerable to the externall coextenſion of all it parts? And where it may be heere replied, that the formes, which are receaued into the Eye are only imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall; we graunt this to be true, and therfore we vrge this Example not to paralell it exactly in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with the other, but to proue thus farre (ſince there ſeemes to be in ſome ſort the like touch of the doubt) that if the one be daily performed by the ordinary courſe of Nature, why may not the other be alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the Omnipotency of that one <hi>(yet Vntuerſall:) Nature,</hi> who gaue the firſt being to this <hi>ſecondarie Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Second Point, wherein I will heere inſiſt, is, that theſe <hi>Species viſibiles,</hi> or formes of Subiects, being multiplied in the Ayre, as they come to the <hi>Eye,</hi> if the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13333:48"/> Ayre be changed, either by any wynd, or ſuddaine alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet (as the chiefeſt <note n="o" place="margin">

                           </gap>ſt Philoſophers.]</hi> Many great Philoſophers of our tyme doe teach, that ſuch Accidences, which doe naturally continue their Inherence in that Body from which they firſt proceed, cannot naturally remoue from this their Subiect into another; ſuch is the whiteneſſe in the Swanne, and the Blackneſſe in a Crow &amp;c. But their Iudgement is otherwiſe in thoſe <hi>Accidences</hi> which haue their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence in another Subiect, then that, from which they originally proceeded; Such is the beames of the Sunne inhering in the Aire, and the formes of Obiects multiplied in the Aire: In theſe they hould, that the Beames of the Sunne, and the formes of the Obiects (being the ſame <hi>numero)</hi> may, and actually doe remoue from one part of the Aire into another, if ſo the Aire it ſelfe be changed: And their Reaſon hereof is this<hi>:</hi> For (ſay theſe Men) the beames of the Sunne, or the formes of Obiects, and the like, haue no affinity with the Aire in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their originall proceeding, but only by reaſon of exiſtency. But any one part of the ayre is as indifferent, and ready to affoard them exiſtence, as another part; Therefore (ſay they) there can be no reaſon aſſigned, why ſuch an Accident may not remoue from Aire to Aire, rather then through the chang only of the firſter part of the Aire to be extinct.</note> Philoſophers of this time, both Catholikes, and Proteſtants doe hould) the ſaid formes (euen <hi>eaedem numero)</hi> are not extinct, but that they inhere in the next ſucceeding Aire, and ſo doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue from one Subiect to another Subiect. Now this conſideration moueth vs thus to conclude; That if the ſame <hi>Accidences</hi> doe naturally remoue from <hi>Subiect</hi> to <hi>Subiect,</hi> without any deſtruction of them, cannot God ſupernaturally preſerue an <hi>Accident</hi> without a <hi>Subiect?</hi> as we Catholikes doe belieue, that he doth ſo preſerue the formes of Bread and Wine in the moſt holy Myſterie of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> And thus farre concerning theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                  <p>But now ſeeing we haue begun to intreate of the Eye, I will end this Chapter with certayne pertinent animaduerſions drawne from this Inſtrument, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to our vnderſtanding, the Eye of our ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we know, that Nature hath giuen to Man two eyes, either of which, though they ſee a thing, as one thing, ſeuerally by themſelues, yet both of them looking vpon the ſame thing, do behold it, but <note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>But as one.]</hi> The Reaſon hereof is, in that the ſight of any thing is not perfectly performed, vntill the forme thereof be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed to the <hi>common Senſe.</hi> Now this Conueyance is made by the meanes of <hi>Neruus Opticus,</hi> which <hi>Neruus</hi> doth deuide it ſelfe into two parts from the Forehead to either Eye: But from the Forehead to the <hi>common Senſe</hi> it is but one; and therefore the forme of any Obiect being carried through this <hi>Neruus Opticus,</hi> doth repreſent the Obiect but as one (not as two) to the <hi>common Senſe.</hi>
                     </note> as one, not as two<hi>:</hi> whereby we may learne, that the Naturall light of our vnderſtanding ought to conſpire, and ioyne with the ſupernaturall light of faith in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending one, and the ſame thing: And ſo in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> our Vnderſtanding, and Reaſon ought not in ſeeing the difficulties thereof to vary from our Faith; but to ſubordinate, and ſubiect it ſelfe to that heauenly, and infuſed Power.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that very part of the <hi>Eye</hi> (to wit, <hi>Pupilla Oculi)</hi> where with we properly ſee, is depriued of all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13333:49"/> Colours, to the end, that it may indifferently ſee all Colours: So ſhould his vnderſtanding (who eyther in this Myſterie of the Euchariſt, or in any other, would ſincerely behould the grounds, and reaſons both of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and Proteſtants) be voyded of all preiudice of iudgment, wherwith the Intellectuall faculty is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcoloured, and blemiſhed: for ſo ſhall he more clearly, and indifferently weigh, and conſider the force of the ſeuerall Reaſons, and Arguments produced on ech ſide.</p>

                     <hi>Optickes</hi> do teach, that one, and the ſame Colour doth appeare, as diuers, eyther to the ſame Eye, or to ſeuerall Eyes, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Angles</hi> (to vſe the impoſed Phraſe herein) <hi>of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation, or Incidency,</hi> made by the entrance of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect into the Eye: wherby we may be admoniſhed, that in points of faith, one, and the ſame Authority doth ſeeme of a different weight, according as the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is afore either lightened with Gods Grace, or darkened with the myſt of Paſſion.

                  <p>HEERE now I will conclude this firſt Part, in which the Reader hath all the chiefe obſcurities of this great Myſterie explicated at large, and diuers of them paralelled by other acknowledged difficulties, both in Diuinity and Philoſophy. For the cloſe wherof I only wiſh him to haue his mind euer fixed in this one poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is: That, <hi>what Faculty, or Operation God doth impart to any thing created, the ſame he alſo</hi> eminenter

                        <hi>Moſt of the abſtruſeſt Points.]</hi> To inſtance this ground in ſome difficulties of the Euchariſt; God hath imparted to a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> the facultie of ſupporting, and ſuſtentating an <hi>Accidence</hi> by meanes of Inherency; therefore it followeth out of this Principle, that God is able of himſelfe to ſupport an <hi>Accident</hi> without it <hi>Subiect,</hi> for otherwiſe he ſhould giue more power, and ability to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, then he keepeth to himſelfe, or can by himſelfe performe, which were both impious, and abſurd to maintaine. In like ſort God hath giuen this property to <hi>Place</hi> (for the better conſeruing of the <hi>Subiect</hi> conteyned) that it ſhould circumſcribe euery ſublunary naturall Body with a certaine coextenſion anſwerable to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of euery ſuch body: Therefore God can of himſelfe (as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue he doth in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt) keep a Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch circumſcription of place; ſince otherwiſe it would follow, that he hath ſo qualified this circumſtance of place to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that, which himſelfe immediately cannot.

                           <hi>It is not better.]</hi> That theſe Figures are not inferior (if not ſuperior) to the Euchariſt (if nothing be there, but Bread, and Wine) either for ſubſtance, or ſignification, it is moſt cleare. And firſt touching the <hi>Paſchall Lambe,</hi> If we conſider a Lambe, and Bread, as things naturall, the Lamb (as being a Creature endued with ſenſe) is more noble. And if we conſider them as Sacraments, that is, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſignes, the Lamb alſo excelleth Bread; for the Fleſh of Chriſt is better repreſented by the fleſh of the Lamb, then by Bread. Againe, the death of Chriſt is more liuely figured by the killing of the Lambe, then by breaking of Bread. Finally, the Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, &amp; other Proprieties of Chriſt are better ſignified by a Lamb without any ſpot (for ſuch the Law commaunded to be ſacrificed) then by Bread. In like ſort, the effect of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is better obtained by the eating of the Lamb, then by eating of bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if the effect therof be a ſpirituall nutrition, we know, that fleſh nouriſheth better then bread; and if it be only a ſtirring vp of a Mans faith, then doth the killing of the Lambe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it better, in that it more liuely ſetteth forth the death of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the <hi>Bloud of the Teſtament,</hi> the ſame former Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which did proue the Lambe to be more noble then Bread, do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſerue to proue, that bloud is better (both for ſubſtance &amp; ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) then the Euchariſt, if nothing be there but Wine; for Bloud is a more noble ſubſtance, then Wine, &amp; the Bloud of Chriſt is better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by bloud, then by wine. Touching the <hi>Manna,</hi> It is in like ſort moſt cleare, that ſuppoſing the Euchariſt to containe in it only bread, it is inferiour to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na.</hi> And firſt conſidering their natures, and eſſences, the <hi>Manna</hi> it moſt excellent, as being made by the hands of the Angells, deſcending from heauen, and hauing in it all kind of taſtes, or ſo taſting, as euery one eating therof would deſire. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe points, we find it called <hi>Panis Angelorum, Pſal</hi> 77. and <hi>Panis de Caelo, Ioan.</hi> 6. wheras bread is made by the hands of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, comming out of an Ouen, and hauing only but the taſt of bread. In like ſort if <hi>Manna,</hi> and bread be conſidered as externall Symboles, and ſignes, <hi>Manna</hi> repreſenteth, or ſignifieth Chriſt better then bread, in that it came from heauen, was indued with all kinds of taſtes, and was receaued of euery one in a like meaſure. Thus we ſee, that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in the old Law, do euery way excel the Euchariſt (they being but Types of the ſame) if ſo nothing be therin, but bread. Now it is euident euen in reaſon, that Figures ought to be inferiour to thoſe things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are Figures; which point alſo appeareth out of the Apoſtle <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ.</hi> 2. who there compareth the Figures of the old Teſtament to the ſhaddowes, and the fulfilling of the ſaid figures to the body.</p>
                        <p>Now, wheras our Aduerſaries do anſwere to our Argument, in ſaying, that our Sacraments (and conſequently the <hi>Euchariſt)</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the Sacraments of the old Law (euen with reference had only to the externall ſignes) becauſe (ſay they) our Sacraments are more firme, as neuer againe to be altered; and becauſe they ſhew, and figure out a thing already done, and not heerafter only to be done, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more ſimple, and belong to a greater multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and laſtly, in that they are more cleere then the other, not ſo much in regard of externall repreſentation, as for the euidency, and cleerneſſe of the words there ſpoken. This is the anſwere of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and particulerly of <hi>Peter Martyr in ſua defenſ. de Euchariſt. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 692. But this taketh not away the force of our Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all theſe Prerogatiues of our Sacraments, aſcribed by him, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall, and accidentary to Sacraments, as they are Symboles, and Signes; ſeeing that they altogeather depend of the bare will of him, who did firſt inſtitute, &amp; ordaine them; &amp; therfore they bring ſmall, or no dignity of ſignes, as they are ſigns; but the compariſon is to be made in the ſignification it ſelfe, in ſeeking the internall dignity, and worth of ſignes, for thoſe ſignes are better, which better do ſignify; but ſignes do ſignify better, or worſe in regard only of their externall ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Adde hereto, that when our Sauiour did firſt inſtitute the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> his death was to come, and conſequently it did then figure a thing to come.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly adde, that the Scripture, and the Fathers do not teach, that our Sacraments do not excell the old Sacraments, becauſe they better ſignify, but becauſe they were but as figures, and the Euchariſt the thing figured, ſo as the compariſon made both in Scriptures, and by the Fathers, is the compariſon of the things abſolutely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, without any reference had of the ſignification of them.</p>

                        <p>This point is alſo made more euident out of the Greeke Text<hi>:</hi> for if <hi>Hoc</hi> ſhould haue demonſtrated Bread, then by the ſame reaſon, the Pronowne <hi>Hic,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Hic eſt Sanguis meus,</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate <hi>Vinum,</hi> and not <hi>Sanguis.</hi> But S. <hi>Luke</hi> is manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſecond point, who <hi>cap.</hi> 22. thus ſaith<hi>:</hi>

                        <p>Touching the Verbe (EST) in the ſaid words of the Inſtitution, which word our Aduerſaries doe ſtriue to prooue, that it is heere taken for <hi>Significat,</hi> whereas the Catholikes doe teach, that the word <hi>Eſt</hi> implyeth heere no other ſignification, then it owne naturall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>Now this is proued; Firſt, becauſe we find not Tropes, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures to be placed in <hi>Verbes,</hi> but by reaſon of ſome peculiar thing, or nature, which is implyed in one Verbe, and not in another; but the Verbe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Touching the word CORPVS, in which word moſt of our Aduerſaries do chooſe rather to place the figure, then in the former Verbe <hi>Eſt:</hi> Now, that this word <hi>Corpus</hi> cannot ſignifie <hi>figura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now, theſe two Greeke Participles, being put in the Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue caſe, ought to be ioyned with a Subſtantiue of the ſame caſe, therfore they are to be ioyned in conſtruction with that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Laſtly, the Body of Chriſt, whereſoeuer it is read in Scripture, is eyther taken for his <hi>Myſticall Body,</hi> to wit, the Church, or for his true, and naturall Body: but for a ſigne, and figure of his body, we neuer find it to be taken. Therfore the Conſtruction of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries giuen of the words of the Inſtitution is moſt forced, &amp; without any example, or preſident of that kind throughout the whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this Pronowne <hi>Hoc,</hi> deſigning ſome particuler thing, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>uents all Figuratiue conſtructions; And therfore we find, that in other acknowledged Metaphoricall ſpeaches of Chriſt touching himſelfe, the Pronowne <hi>Hoc</hi> is wanting, as in theſe, <hi>Ego ſum Oſtium, Ego ſum Vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all Metaphoricall ſpeaches, that are vſed by way of Explication, it is not accuſtomed, that one thing do predicate, or be affirmed of another thing, except the <hi>Praedicatum</hi> be ſome ſuch thing, in the which the propriety (according to the which the ſimilitude of the Metaphor is chiefly intended) is more knowne and euident, then it is in the other thing, of the which the ſaid Metaphor is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And this is the reaſon, that in Metaphoricall Propoſitions one thing doth predicate of another, for the moſt part <hi>in genere,</hi> or <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> at leaſt; But no ſuch obſeruation is heere found in the words of the Inſtitution. For heere (according to our Aduerſaries) the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt are affirmed of Bread, and Wine, and yet the vertue of nouriſhing (which they heere aſſigne to be the ground of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed figuratiue ſpeach) is leſſe euident and knowne in the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, then in the Bread and Wine, which before his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the words, Chriſt did hould in his hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is to be obſerued, that in the words of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Body and Bloud of Chriſt do not expreſly predicate, or are affirmed of Bread and Wine, but only they do predicate of a word ſignifying ſome thing, but with confuſion and vncertainty, to wit, of the Pronowne <hi>Hoc.</hi> And yet in other metaphoricall ſpeaches euer a thing which is of one nature, doth predicate of another thing of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, as <hi>Chriſtus erat petra</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we are heere to note the words following; to wit, <hi>quod pro vobis datur, qui pro vobis effunditur</hi> &amp;c. Which are added to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the truth and propriety of the precedent Affirmation. But in all Metaphoricall Affirmations nothing for the moſt part is wont to beadded, but what doth more clearly expreſſe the propriety of that thing, from the ſimilitude wherof the Metaphor is drawne.</p>
                        <p>Thus one may ſay<hi>: Caeſar was a Lion, by reaſon of his courage &amp; fortitude,</hi> which later words are added to expreſſe more cleerly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Metaphor. But now if the addition of words following, doth not explicate the ſimilitude of a Metaphor, but abſolutely doth ſhew the truth of the thing therin affirmed, then doth ſuch an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion manifeſt withall the Propriety of the precedent affirmation: as in theſe words<hi>: That Chriſt ſuffered vpon the Croſſe, who was borne of a Virgin,</hi> where we find, that the later words not expreſſing any ſimilitude of a Metaphor, do intimate a Propriety and literall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former words concerning Chriſt. In like ſort we ſay, that thoſe words<hi>: Quod pro vobis tradetur, &amp;, Qui pro vobis fundetur &amp;c. VVhich ſtalbe diliuered for you &amp;c.</hi> and, <hi>VVhich ſhall be ſhed for you &amp;c.</hi> do not import and ſignify any vertue of nouriſhing, which they ſhould haue done, if the Propoſitions (to which they are adioyned) had bene Metaphoricall; but they do ſignify, that Chriſts Body and Bloud were the pryce of our Redemption, which point hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary coniunction with the vertue and faculty of nouriſhing. And thus much in further explication of the word of the Inſtitution.</p>

In Engliſh thus: <hi>The Chalice of benediction, which we do bleſſe, is it not the communication of the bloud of Chriſt? And the Bread, which we breake, is it not the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> Now this place affoards diuers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in proofe of our Catholike doctrine. And Firſt from thoſe firſt words, <hi>Calix benedictionis, cui benedicimus.</hi> Out of which words we deduce, that <hi>Conſecration</hi> is neceſſary to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; but it were not neceſſary, if the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> were but only a Figure of our Sauiours Body, ſince for the effecting of thus much, the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, and his will manifeſted in the Holy Scriptures were ſufficient; for the <hi>Paſchall Lambe,</hi> and <hi>Manna</hi> were figures of Chriſts Body, &amp; Sacraments (according to our Aduerſaries doctrine) and yet there was not required any conſecration for the making of thoſe figures. In like ſort we find, that no Conſecration is vſed to the water of Baptiſme, to make it thereby a Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Another Argument may be taken from the words, <hi>Panis, quem frangimus.</hi> In which place the word <hi>Fractio,</hi> is as much as <hi>Immolatio,</hi> or <hi>Oblatio,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, quod pro vobis frangitur:</hi> For all theſe are the words of the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle, and intreating of the ſame matter.

Now then, if in this place <hi>Frangere,</hi> doth ſignify <hi>Immolare,</hi> to immolate, or offer vp in Sacrifice; then it ineuitably followeth, that the word <hi>Panis,</hi> doth not here ſignify naturall wheaten bread, but the very Body of Chriſt, which is ſuperſubſtantiall, &amp; celeſtiall Bread; for no man will ſay, that we doe immolate, and offer vp to God plaine naturall Bread.</p>

Now this conſtruction heerof is proued, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in euery place in the Scriptures, the fleſh is diſtinguiſhed againſt the ſpirit; as we find in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and in diuers other places; Therfore our Sauiours meaning in the former wordes is, that to thinke, that the fleſh of Chriſt is to be eaten after a carnall manner, as other meates are, to wit, to be cut in pieces, to be boyled, to be conuerted into our proper ſubſtance by force of the naturall heat (in which ſenſe the <hi>Capharnaites</hi> did afore think our Lord to haue ſpoken) that thus carnally to imagine, profiteth nothing; and therfore our Lord immediately ſubioyneth, <hi>Verba, quae ego locutus ſum vobis, ſpiritus &amp; vita ſunt,</hi> that is, they are words explicating diuine, &amp; ſpirituall things, and ſuch as bring eternall life, and therfore they are not to be vnderſtood after a humane, and carnall ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>But let vs ſuppoſe, that Chriſt ſpake of his fleſh, yet it proueth nothing againſt his being in the Euchariſt, both becauſe by the ſame reaſon, we may conclude, that the bread is not in the Sacrament; for if the body of Chriſt profiteth vs nothing, much leſſe will a little peece of wheaten bread profit vs: Againe, if our Lord had ſpoken of his fleſh, he would not haue vnderſtood it abſolutely, but only that the fleſh without the ſpirit profiteth nothing; ſince otherwiſe our Lord ſhould haue croſſed himſelfe, who ſaith euen in the ſaid Chapter, <hi>Qui manducat carnem meam, habet vitam aeternam.]</hi> Laſtly, it is no leſſe then a great impiety to deny, that the fleſh of Chriſt (being vnited with his Diuinity) profiteth vs nothing, ſeeing that <hi>S.

                        <p>Firſt, becauſe that Councell was gathered chiefely to condemne the contrary doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> then firſt broaching this Hereſy; ſo as this Councell did then ſuppreſſe, and diſallow all innouation of doctrine; which very point is acknowledged by <hi>Fox</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Monurn. pag.</hi> 1121. who thus there writeth: <hi>About the yeare of our Lord</hi> 1060. <hi>the denying of Tranſubſtantiation began to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereſy, and in that number was firſt Berengarius, who liued about Ann.

                        <p>Secondly, It is moſt improbable, that a Councell gathered out of all the moſt diſtant Nations of Chriſtendome, ſhould vpon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo conſpiringly imbrace an innouation of doctrine ſo contrary to Senſe, as the Catholike doctrine herein is.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and Laſtly, The Proteſtants themſelues doe acquite this Councell from bringing in the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, ſince they doe charge diuers Fathers therewith, lyuing long before this Councell of Lateran.

                  <p>The firſt wherof ſhall be taken from the different appellations of this great Myſterie, giuen by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and by the Fathers: where we are to remember, that ſince Mans immanent Thought (which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward progreſſion of the Mind) is beſt become <hi>Tranſient,</hi> or externally manifeſted by the Mediation of wordes; Therfore <hi>Nature</hi> (Gods obſequious Agent) hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the vſe of <hi>Speach,</hi> which Speach ought among men to be a true &amp; ſincere Interpreter of the Soules men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Language, for we find thoſe to haue bene greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>Qui</hi>

                  <p>Now then let vs ſee, how the Fathers in words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title this Sacrament.

But what? Is this the Dialect of our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Or, are they accuſtomed to ſpeake in this manner of language? No. For when they ſpeake of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, their naturall and mother tongue, is to tearme it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Symboles, and ſignes of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p>But now to come to theſe Teſtimonies, wherin the Euchariſt is thus termed, and to beginne with the latter part of the fifth Age, that ſo aſcending vp by degrees to higher tymes, we may conſequently aſcend in force, &amp; weight of Argument, drawn from ſuch their Authorities.

The places that in this ſort I make choice of, are ſuch, as ſeeme more conuincing, &amp; euident then the reſt, ſo that if the Reader do ſee, that the more forcible authorities are free from all ſuſpected corruption in the tranſlating of them, he may the more probably aſſure himſelfe, that the reſt are in no ſort wreſted from their true, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaning; for who in this ſort corrupteth, is preſumed to vſe his art in thoſe paſſages, as make moſt for his adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> SECOND Branch of the Fathers Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, may extend it ſelfe to the Change, which is made in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt; which change, that it is reall, is neceſſarily included in their writings. For they teach, that after the Mutation is once made, the Bread remayneth not: and in further acknowledgment heerof they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely do paralell it with other reall Mutations. As firſt with that of the Water turned by our Sauiour into Wine; But if an imminent Act of his will was of Power to turn water into wine, cannot a Tranſient operation of the ſaid will (breaking out into words of a poſitiue Aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) change wine into Bloud? Secondly, they compare the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13333:74"/> change heere with that of the Wands of <hi>Moyſes</hi> turned into Serpents. But what proportion can there be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe ſtupendious Mutations, and a little repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatiue Bread, and Wine, ſtill remayning Bread, and Wine? Therfore we may iuſtly ſay, that as thoſe true Serpents <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>True ſerpents.]</hi> Exod. 7.</note> of <hi>Moyſes</hi> did eate vp thoſe counterfaite Serpents made in emulation therof by the falſe Prophets, euen ſo ought the reall Tranſelementation taught by the Fathers, exyle, and baniſh this but Sacramentall, and Sophiſticated chang, brought in by the Sacramentaries.</p>
                  <p>They further teach, for the more facilitating of this great worke, that he, who could firſt giue the Eſſence and Forme to euery thing, could more eaſily ſuperinduce a ſecond forme. And therefore with good reaſon one of them ſaith, <hi>Non</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now then by reaſon of the true, and reall chang heere made, the Fathers doe further write, that our Senſe (which in other things hath a great Soueraignty ouer our Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) is heere deceaued; for though the Eye would perſuade vs, that there is Bread, and Wine in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, yet they ſay plainly, that there is neither bread, nor wyne; thus teaching, that the vnderſtanding heere cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> THIRD point (which indeed is the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter wherin the Lines of diuers ſuch paſſages doe meet) manifeſting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beliefe heerein, may be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their Compariſons of the Euchariſt with other things. Thus they compare it with the <hi>Paſchal Lambe,</hi> with the <hi>Manna,</hi> with <hi>Panis Propoſitions;</hi> teaching, that it doth tranſcend all theſe, as much as a Diuine, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſumptible ſubſtance excells a terrene, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Body the ſhaddow, and the Truth the Figure. But if Chriſts Body be heere only by repreſentation, then is the Euchariſt a thing corruptible, a ſhadow, and a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13333:79"/> meere Figure; and then may our Sauiour worthily vſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them the expoſtulation in <hi>Eſay, Cui</hi>

                  <p>Others alſo in regard of the ſublimity therof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the <hi>Creation</hi> (as I touched before) where (not to inſiſt in other points) we find, that by force of the Creation, all Creatures are conteyned in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour (for <hi>in ipſo viuimus</hi> &amp;c.) and by force of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Creatour is conteyned (after a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) vnder the formes of ſome of his meaneſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Some likewiſe do teach (beſides other ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons) that Chriſt in the Sacrament is to the eye of the ſoule, as when Angells by aſſuming bodyes appeared to Men, though theſe being ſpirituall, ſeemed corporall, and Chriſt being Corporall appeareth heere only as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
                  <p>Finally, diuers of them ſeeme to equall it with the Myſterie of the <hi>Incarnation;</hi> and one Father reſembleth the difficulty herein to that, where Chriſt (being as well God as Man) was borne of a Woman, and a Virgin. Now, if the chiefeſt obſcuritie in the Euchariſt doth reſt in Types, Repreſentations, and Reſemblances, how cold, diſproportionable, diſſorting, yea abſurd and falſe are the compariſons heere made with thoſe former ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Myſteries of Chriſtianity, and particulerly of the Incarnation? Where (to omit all other paſſages ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aboue our capacity) we find the Vine to bud out of the Branch; the Ocean to flow from a ſhallow Riuer; and the Sunne to borrow it light from a ſmall Starre.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13333:80"/> words were falſe, becauſe the Paſchall Lamb was in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification the Body of Chriſt, as well as the Bread; as is proued aboue.</p>
                  <p>He alſo in <hi>epiſt.</hi> 86. <hi>ad Caſulanum,</hi> where reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one <hi>Vrbicus,</hi> for teaching that the Law was ſo turned into the Ghoſpell, as that a ſheep ſhould giue place to Bread, and Bloud to the Cup, thus writeth: <hi>Dicit ceſſiſſe pani pecus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vrbicus</hi> ſayth, <hi>that ſheepe did giue place to Bread, as being ignorant, that euen then</hi> Panes Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, <hi>the breads of Propoſition, were wont to be placed vpon the Table of the Lord, and that now himſelfe taketh part of the body of the immaculate Lambe: in lyke ſort, he ſayth, that Bloud did giue place to the Cup, not remembring, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe now taketh Bloud in the Cup.]</hi> And then a litle after <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſubioyneth: <hi>Quanto ergo melius &amp;c. How much better, and more agreeingly might</hi> Vrbicus <hi>haue ſayd, that thoſe ancient things did ſo paſſe away, &amp; ſo became new in Chriſt, that the Altar ſhould giue place to the Altar, the ſword to the ſword, fire to fire, bread to bread, ſheep to ſheep, bloud to bloud.]</hi> But heere <hi>Vrbicus</hi> (according to the ſentence of our Aduerſaries) did not erre, for if we reſpect the ſigne, or repreſentation only, Chriſt was no leſſe in the Sheep of the Old Law, then now in Bread; and his Bloud no leſſe in that Bloud, then in our Wyne. And therefore in our Aduerſaries iudgements, the ſheep did truly giue place to Bread, and Bloud to Wyne.</p>

                     <hi>meum</hi> &amp;c.] In this place the body, and bloud of Chriſt is cleerely oppoſed to the Bread, and Wine of <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> And his Body, and Bloud is heere called <hi>True Bread,</hi> and <hi>True Bloud</hi> (to wit, in regard of the effect, which is to nouriſh our Soules, but not in reſpect of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) for if we reſpect the Nature of Bread, the Bread of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was true Bread.</p>

There is as great difference betweene</hi> Panes Propoſitionis <hi>(the Shew-Bread) and the Body of Chriſt, as there is betweene the Image, and the Truth; betweene the Examples of Truths, and thoſe Truths, which are prefigured by the Examples.]</hi> Where we are to note, that in this place <hi>Hierome</hi> entreateth particulerly of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. Now if in the Euchariſt be the Truth which was figured <hi>per panes Propoſitionis,</hi> then there is not in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt materiall Bread ſignifying the Body of Chriſt, but the true Body it ſelfe; for the body of Chriſt (euen in the iudgement of all) was that Truth, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by thoſe Breads.</p>

Thus in this <hi>Antitheſis</hi> doth <hi>S. Chryſoſtome</hi> conclude, that we haue his body in a more worthy ſort, then the <hi>Magi</hi> had it; which he could not affirme truly, if we haue his Body only in ſigne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.</p>

For who is carried in his owne hands? A man may be carried in the hands of another, but in his owne hands he cannot be carryed. How this may be literally vnderſtood in <hi>Dauid,</hi> we find not, but in Chriſt we find<hi>:</hi> for Chriſt was carryed in his owne hands, when commending his body, he ſayd, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> for then did he carry that body in his owne hands.] But if Chriſt did carry his body in his owne hands, only in ſigne, and repreſentation (as a Man bearing about him the picture of himſelfe) then were it no difficult thing; and yet S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, it is a thing impoſſible, and cannot be performed, but only by Chriſt. Neither do our Aduerſaries ſatisfy this place in replying, that Chriſt did carry himſelfe in a Sacrament, but none but Chriſt can inſtitute a Sacrament, and conſequently none can carry themſelues, as Chriſt did. This, I ſay, auayleth nothing, becauſe our Aduerſaries doe confeſſe, that Chriſt is ſaid to carry himſelfe in the Sacrament,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13333:87"/> not becauſe a Sacrament is an Inſtrument of conferring Grace (for this they deny) but becauſe it is a ſigne of Chriſt; and ſo in this laſt reſpect there is no difficultie for one to carry himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly <hi>S.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of the Fathers writings in this Point; out of which abſtract, we may eaſily extract their Faith, and Beliefe had in this high Myſterie, and withall conclude, that the Sacramentaries are no more diſtant, &amp; remote from the Times, wherin the Fathers liued then from the Doctrine maintayned in the ſaid Tymes. For (as we haue ſhewed) the Fathers not contenting themſelues with ordinary, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue, and meaſured ſpeaches deliuered of the Euchariſt, do vſe high, and ſuperlatiue Titles of the dignity, and worth therof: The Sacramentaries only affoard ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13333:99"/> as Nature hath already giuen to the ſame. The Fathers acknowledging heerin a true, and reall Change, haue paralelled it with the greateſt ſupernaturall Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges whatſoeuer: The Sacramentaries can find no other alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but that afore it being common Bread, &amp; Wine, is now only reſerued (a ſtrange, and ſtupendious Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) for the vſe of their Winy Communion.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers poſtpoſe the Types of the Old Law to it, yea compare it with the chiefeſt Articles of Chriſtian Faith: The Sacramentaries as long as they teach, that it but Typically repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the Body, &amp; Bloud of Chriſt, can at the moſt but prize it at the equall valew of thoſe Legall Figures.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers aſcribed the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion there made, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Omnipotency of God, affirming, that not ſenſe, but only Faith is able to conceaue the Myſteries therin: The Sacramentaries (for the more cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenancing of their Bread, and Wine) verbally ſomtymes acknowledge, that a liuely Faith only is of force to apprehend the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe their repreſenting Elements. O the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith of our Sectaries! the worke (no doubt) of the Holy Ghoſt! the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> able (according to the Apoſtle) to moue Mountaines, tranſcending the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and niggard Limits of Senſe, and Reaſon, ſince it is of power (moſt ſupernaturally) to apprehend, how one thing may repreſent, and ſignify another thing! But to paſſe on.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers do attribute euen moſt diuine, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall effects to this Sacrament: The Sacramentaries, what efficacy they aſſigne therunto (to wit, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of Chriſt by Faith) do teach, that it riſeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſignification, and remembrance of Chriſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13333:99"/> implyed in the externall Signes, the which may as auaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (euen by their owne Principles) be performed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their ten-ſhilling-Sermons.</p>
                  <p>The Fathers exhibited with great humility all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Chriſts Body there preſent: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaries cannot be induced to giue any ſuch reſpect at all. Finally, the Fathers do maintayne, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is a true, and Propitiatory Oblation: The Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries acknowledge no other Oblation in the Church, then only a ſpirituall Sacrifice of Prayer, and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee, what Alienaton there is betweene the Writings of the Fathers, and of our Nouelliſts. But we are not to meruaile, that the Sacramentaries doe neuer ſpeake in one, and the ſame Catholike Idiome with thoſe Primitiue Doctours, ſince they are deafe heerin, and will not be brought to heare, what the Church of God, either in thoſe ancient Tymes, or in theſe latter dayes do teach concerning the ſame; And we know, it is a Concluſion in Philoſophy, that, <hi>He who neuer heareth, neuer ſpeaketh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I conclude this Point, I will put the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in remembrance of ſome other Obſeruations contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Teſtimonyes of the Fathers, which may at leaſt morally aſſure him, that they maintayned our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine of the Euchariſt: Moſt of which Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations (though different from the foreſaid heads) are to be found in their former alleaged Authorities: Others of them in other their Sentences: Of both which for aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging the Readers memory, and for auoyding a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome prolixity, I will only referre him to the places, where ſuch their Sentences may be read.</p>
                  <p>As firſt we find, that the Fathers reſting vpon the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13333:100"/> doctrine of the Reall Preſence, as a confeſſed Article of Chriſtian Faith, did from thence, as from an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Principle refell diuers Hereſyes. Thus did <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly they acknowledge a great miracle to reſt, that Chriſt as being in the Euchariſt, is in diuers ſeuerall places at one and the ſame tyme. Thus doth <note n="f" place="margin">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOVGH in ſetting downe the Authorities of the Fathers in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapters, I haue illuſtrated moſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſuch ſhort Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions, as beſt vnfould the true Senſe of the ſaid Authorities, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently preuent all ſuch ſleighty elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as are vſed by our Aduerſaries for the auoyding of the ſame: Neuertheleſſe I haue thought good heere to amaſſe togeather all their diuers kinds of Anſweres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeuerally applyed in generall to the produced ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the former chief Heads (for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to all Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13333:103"/> of one Nature, they do appropriate one, &amp; the ſame Anſwere.) Thus ſhall the diſcreet Reader haue at once a <hi>Synopſis,</hi> or entire view of the Sacramentaries fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble euaſions, being full of tergiuerſation, and diſtruſt.</p>
                  <p>Now then, one Kind of their Anſwers (if ſo I may terme it) is to giue no anſwere at all; for when they are preſſed with ſuch perſpicuous, and euident places of the Fathers, as are in no ſort to be obſcured with any myſt of words (for the Sunne is ſometimes ſo radiant, as that it cannot be ouerclouded) then in their Replyes to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bookes therin, they are content, not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof (like men of good natures) to ſuffer all ſuch ſentences quietly to paſſe by them in Gods name, &amp; the Kings. Thus we find moſt cleere paſſages of the Fathers ſet downe in Catholike Bookes, yet neuer anſwered by <hi>Caluin, Peter Martyr,</hi> or others, who haue vndertaken a refutation of the ſaid Bookes, but altogeather paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as if no ſuch places had bene obiected: Such care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pylotes they are, as willing to auoyd the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rocks. Which courſe of theirs I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not condemne as impoliticke, ſince it is leſſe diſaduantagious ſilently to giue way to all ſuch Aſſertions, then by oppoſition to diſplay openly the forces of the ſame; for we ſee, that the ſtrength of the Wind is beſt diſcerned by finding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Of the many Authorities of the Fathers, wherunto the Proteſtants (to wit <hi>Caluin, Peter Martyr</hi> &amp;c.) giue no Anſwere at all, I haue thought good to note theſe few, viz. <hi>The Paſsion of S.

                  <p>The firſt forme then of their Poſitiue Anſwers may be aſſigned to thoſe Authorityes, wherin the Fathers doe abſolutely call the Euchariſt, the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt; as where they teach, that we doe eate his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and drinke his Bloud, or that the Body, and Bloud, which we receau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the Euchariſt is our pryce, the Pledge of our Saluation, or the like.</p>
                  <p>To the Teſtimonyes of this Nature, our Aduerſaries do ſhape a double Anſwere. For either they vnderſtand thoſe places of the True Body, and Bloud of Chriſt, as it is in Heauen, and receaued by vs by faith; or elſe of the ſignes thereof, which we truly, and really doe take in the Euchariſt. But if we doe obſerue intenſly, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately the circumſtances of thoſe Paſſages, it will be euident, that neither part of this Anſwere is in any ſort ſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, that the Fathers meaning is not, that we take his Body (as it is in Heauen) by faith, is proued, in that you ſhall for the moſt part euer find, that in ſuch places they teach, that we receaue it from the Altar, or at the Prieſts hands (and conſequently not as it is in Heauen) or that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is his Body, and Bloud: or finally you ſhall find there ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like acceſſion of Words, as doe force the Place to be interpreted of his Body, and Bloud, as it is vnder the externall formes, and not as it is in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the ſecond Branch of their former
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13333:104"/> Euaſion, to wit, that the ſaid Teſtimonyes are not to be interpreted of the Bread, and Wyne ſignifying, and figuring his Body, &amp; Bloud, in which they ſay Chriſts Body is ſymbolically taken, is no leſſe manifeſt; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof being this: Becauſe the words of thoſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonyes doe almoſt euer intimate ſome effect, or effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Euchariſt, which to Bread, and Wyne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent; as that it nouriſheth our Soules, or that it is the Price, or Pledge of our Saluation, or hope of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or that it ſuffered for our Sinnes, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch ſpirituall worke, energy, or operation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the bare Symboles of the Euchariſt are not capable.</p>
                  <p>Thus may the obſeruant Reader cleerely diſcerne the feeblenes of this their Anſwere, and conclude with himſelfe, that ſuch Teſtimonyes of the Fathers cannot be conſtrued of Chriſts Body, as it is in Heauen; ſince the Words precedent, or conſequent reſtraine it to the Altar<hi>:</hi> Nor of Bread, and Wyne Symbolically, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally repreſenting the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt; ſince Bread, and Wyne cannot produce the ſpirituall Effects there ſpecified<hi>:</hi> ſo cleare it is, that our Sectary in approaching to anſwere the ſaid Sentences, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euitably runne vpon ſome one circumſtantiall pyke, or other, of the ſaid Authorityes, wherewith he is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded.</p>
                  <p>That this my Reply may be more cleerely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I will inſtance it in this one Teſtimony following which ſhall ſerue, as a Precedent for all the reſt of the ſame nature; The like couſe of exemplifying I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in all other kynds of their Anſwers; and though ſuch places were afore alledged, yet here they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vpon a different occaſion.</p>

                     <hi>S. Augustine</hi> then <hi>in l.</hi> 6. <hi>Confeſſ. c.</hi> 13. thus writeth touching his Mother: <hi>Tantummodo memoriam ſui ad Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re tuum fieri deſiderauit, vnde ſciret diſpenſari Victimam ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam, qua deletum eſt chyrographum, quod erat contrarium nobis.]</hi> Only ſhe deſired, that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of her might be made at thy Altar, from whence ſhe did know the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice to be diſpenſed <hi>(or giuen)</hi> by the which the hand-writing, which was contrary to vs is defaced.] Out of this place we proue (as we ſhewed aboue) that by <hi>Victima ſancta</hi> here ſpecified by <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Body and Bloud of Chriſt. Now heere it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be anſwered, that the Body of Chriſt is meant, as it is in Heauen; becauſe he ſaith, that this <hi>Victima</hi> is diſpenſed, or diſtributed from the Altar, which thing agreeth not with his Body, as it is in Heauen: Neither can it be ſaid (as ſome ſeeme to interprete it) of the Bread, and Wine Typically ſignifying the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt, in that the Bread &amp; Wine was not the Sacrifice, which was offered for vs vpon the Croſſe. And thus much of this firſt kind of our Aduerſaries Anſwere.</p>
                  <p>Another forme of euading the preſſures, &amp; weights of the Fathers Authorityes is this: That if in the allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Authority, there can be found but any one word, which is to be accepted not litterally, but figuratiuely, metaphorically, or in ſome other forced conſtruction; then our Allegoricall Sectarie inferres therupon, that the whole Sentence (though moſt ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly fortifying the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine heerin) is to be taken figuratiuely, &amp; not literally, vrging, that ſeeing, both the points are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in one, and the ſame Sentence, or Period, and that the one by our confeſſion is not to be vnderſtood literally, why ſhould the other obiected by vs, be taken literally?</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:13333:105"/>
                  <p> The Tranſparency of which Anſwere is eaſily ſeene through. And firſt we are to know, and obſerue, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, which is not deliuered in plaine, and literall words, proceedeth not alwayes from an intention of Rhetoricke, or Amplification in the Writer, but often euen out of Neceſſity, ſince ſomtimes we are forced ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as not hauing that natiue habit of ſpeach, &amp; words, wherwith otherwiſe we would apparrell the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of our Mind; which ſcarſitie of apt wordes, may perhaps be ſometimes found in the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: yet hence it followeth not, that all the reſt (adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therto) muſt partake of the ſame want.</p>
                  <p>Againe, whether this kind of writing riſeth out of a defect of words, or out of a delicacy, and choiceneſſe of a Mans pen, yet the Argument hence deduced is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent, ſince by this reaſon we may inferre, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no one Text of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> may be alleaged as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally to proue, or diſproue any thing: and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome adioyning parcell therof is ſet downe in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue kind of ſpeach. And thus we cannot alleadge (contrary to all ancient Expoſitours) that Text in the Apocalyps, <hi>Theſe are they, which haue waſhed their Robes, &amp; haue made them white in the Bloud of the Lambe, cap.</hi> 7. to proue, that Martyrs, and other Saints of God are ſaued by the Bloud of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> becauſe (forſooth) in the ſaid Sentence there are two Metaphors; to wit, the long Robes (wherby are ſignified the Bodyes of the Saints) and the word Lambe (meaning therby Chriſt) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould follow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid ground, that the word <hi>Bloud,</hi> muſt alſo be here a Metaphor, not ſignifying bloud indeed (and ſo excluding the Bloud of Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſaluation) but ſome other thing ſhaddowed therby.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13333:106"/> Yea which is more (if this kind of Anſwere were ſolide) we could ſcarce produce any one ſentence of the Pſalmes, literally to be expounded of Chriſt, or his Church (in which Authorityes we Chriſtians mainly inſiſt againſt the Iewes) ſince that part of Scripture is moſt luxuriant of Tropes, Schemes, and other Figuratiue ſpeaches; And yet we ſee, that it is moſt incongruous to maintaine, that any whole Pſalme is to be interpreted Allegorically, becauſe we find certaine Figures in ſome Paſſages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is euident, how defectiue this Anſwere is, which conſiſteth in reſoluing the Fathers ſentences into Figuratiue Senſes. But our Aduerſaries boldneſſe ſtayeth not heere in deprauing after this ſort Mans word; but extendeth it ſelfe to corrupt in like manner (by ouer much origenizing, and myſtically interpreting it) Gods ſacred word.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond Forme of Anſwere I will illuſtrate with this Teſtimony following. <hi>S. Chryſoſtome Homil. de Euchariſt. in Encaenijs,</hi> thus writeth. <hi>Num vides Panem? num Vinum? num ſicut reliqui cibi in ſeceſſum vadunt? Abſit, ne nec cogites. Quemadmodum enim ſi cera igni adhibita illi aſſimilatur, nihil ſubſtantiae remanet, nihil ſuperfluit; ſic &amp; hic put a myſteria conſumi corporis ſubſtantia.</hi> Doeſt thou ſee Bread? doeſt thou ſee Wyne? doe theſe things goe into the common paſſage, as other meates? Let it be farre from thee to thinke ſo. For euen as Waxe being put in the fire, is aſſimilated, or made like to it, no part of the ſubſtance remayning: or redounding: So heere imagine, that the Myſteries are conſumed through the Subſtance of the Body.] Of this place I haue entreated aboue. But heere now we are to take notice, that our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13333:106"/> labour to delude the force therof by anſwering, that thoſe words of this Teſtimony <hi>Myſteria conſumi,</hi> are not to be vnderſtood literally (for ſo they ſhould be falſe) in that the externall Formes of Bread, and Wyne (which are conteyned in the word <hi>Mysteria)</hi> are not conſumed by the acceſſion of the Body of Chriſt: for we ſee that the Accidences of Bread, and Wyne remaine euen after Conſecration; ſeeing then, ſay they, that theſe words are not to be taken literally, but figuratiuely, therefore the whole ſentence aforegoing is alſo to be taken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, and not literally. And thus they ſeeke to euade this moſt pregnant Teſtimony; whereby the Word <hi>Mysteria</hi> is vnderſtood, that the Subſtance only of the Bread, and Wyne are conſumed.</p>
                  <p>A third Branch of their Euaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſhootes out to ſuch Authorityes of the Fathers, as refer the effectuating of this Myſtery to Gods ſole Omnipotency, marſhalling it (in regard of the difficulties diſcouered therein) with the abſtruſeſt points of Chriſtianity, and ranging it (by reaſon of the great Miracle there exhibited) with the greateſt Miracles euer performed by God.</p>
                  <p>Now their Anſwere heerto is, that the Euchariſt is wrought by the Omnipotency of God; for ſeeing it is a Sacrament, not Man, but God only (and conſequently his Omnipotency is heere neceſſarily exacted) is able to inſtitute the ſame. How rouing, and wandring this is from the ſcope, and drift of the Fathers ſhall heere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Firſt from the words of the Fathers themſelues, which doe euen depoſe a contrary meaning in them; for they in thoſe places alledged of this nature, doe not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the Omnipotency of God to the Euchariſt, as it is a Sacrament (for hereof they intimate for the moſt part,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13333:107"/> not the leaſt touch) but to it, as therein one Subſtance by force of certaine words, is truly turned into another Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the weakneſſe of the former Anſwere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, in that we graunt, that an Omnipotency indeed is required to the Inſtitution of any Sacrament, wherby it ſhould iuſtifie a Man: but our Aduerſaries will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that the Sacraments (as Inſtruments of Chriſt, &amp; where due preparation is) do confer immediately Grace (for this were in them an ouer-vnkind relinquiſhing of Senſe, and too ſtraite an Entercourſe, &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce with their vnderſtanding) but they teach, that the Sacraments do iuſtify vs, only by ſignifying, and repreſentation; becauſe (ſay they) they are made things to vs, in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification wherof we apprehend Chriſt by Faith. And ſo their Omnipotency heere formally reſteth in creating a new ſignification of a thing; to wit, that the naturall ſubſtance of the Sacraments ſhould repreſent, &amp; ſignify Chriſt, whom (afore his Inſtitution therof) they did not ſignify. Now, if Omnipotency muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the making, that one thing may ſignify another thing, then by the ſaid ground euery ſeely Ale-wife is Omnipotent, in that her red Lattice, or Buſh at the doore (things of themſelues indifferent, as not carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any reference to her profeſſion) are made by her to be a ſufficient Type, Signe, or Repreſentation to the Paſſengers, of the Ale which ſhe hath to ſell; ſo cleare it is, that a Reall change, not an Impoſition of a new ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification requireth an Omnipotency. Now (as in the former I haue done) I will inſtance this anſwere in ſome one authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Cyprian Serm. de Coena Dom.</hi> (of which place I haue
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13333:107"/> entreated aboue) thus writeth: <hi>Panis iste, quem Dominus Diſcipulis porrigebat, non effigie, ſed natura mutatus, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentia Verbi factus est Caro &amp;c.</hi> This Bread, which our Lord gaue to his Diſciples, being changed not in outward ſhew, but in nature, is by the Omnipotency of the Word made Fleſh.] Now, what intimation is heere made to aſcribe the Omnipotency of God heere expreſſed, to the Euchariſt, only in that it is a Sacrament? Or with what tecture, or pretext of Reaſon can any ſuch exorbitant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be heere forged? ſince (as is already proued) an Omnipotency is required in the Inſtitution of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may truely performe that, which they do ſignify, to wit, that they do iuſtify Man (but this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of them, our Sacramentaries do altogeather reiect) but no Omnipotency is exacted to make, that a thing may ſignify what afore it did not, for this not only God, but Man is able to performe.</p>
                  <p>Their fourth Anſwere belongeth to ſuch places, which preferre the Euchariſt before the Iewiſh Types, and Figures (wherin Chriſt was as perfectly ſhaddowed and ſignified as in the Euchariſt, if there be nothing elſe there, but Bread, and Wine.) The inſufficiency of the Sacramentaries Anſwere heerto made, is fully, and at large diſplayed in the Marginall References touching the diuerſity of the Types of the Euchariſt, and the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt it ſelfe: to which <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>To which place.]</hi> Viz. the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Tract.</note> place I referre the Reader, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as affecting heere expedition, &amp; breuity; and partly as being loath, weariſomely to cloy with a needleſſe iteration of one, &amp; the ſame thing, the faſtidious eares of our curious Age.</p>
                  <p>Another forme of their ſhuffling Anſweres is that, wherwith they labour to breake through all ſuch Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13333:108"/> of the Fathers, which do aſſigne any reuerence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer to the Euchariſt eyther of Adoration, Inuocation, or in any other ſort. To all which they giue vs this yaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, heedleſſe, and doubtfull ſolution: That if any ſuch reuerence was exhibited by the Fathers to the Euchariſt, it was not terminated in the Euchariſt it ſelfe, but dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Chriſt (ſignified therein) and ſo by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe earthly Elements, transferred to him, who is in Heauen; no otherwiſe then when the Papiſts (for thus do they particulerly inſtance) praying before I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, direct not their prayers to the Image, but to Chriſt, or the Saint repreſented therein. But heere I would aske them what ſecret Intelligence they (now comming ſo long after) can haue of the Fathers minds, and intentions heerin? If they inſiſt in the words, we find no appearance of the leaſt glance thereof; if they call to mind the practiſe of the Church of thoſe Ages (the ſecureſt Scholie, or Paraphraſe of the Fathers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) it ſeales vp the Truth in our behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore I ſay, that the Sacramentary is of a Lethargious, and forgetfull conſtitution (a point, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old <hi>Oportet</hi> &amp;c. very diſaduantagious to his profeſſion;) or if not ſo, then is he ſo Serpentinely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt the Catholikes, as that, ſo he may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them, he is content to be vnfaithfull to himſelfe. For at other times he ryots both in Pulpit, and by Pen with great profuſion of Words, and Tyme, telling ſuch as will belieue him, that the Catholikes doe pray to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and place in them a kind of Diuinity; whereas now, he is content (courteouſly) to acknowledge the lawfull, and religious practiſe of the Catholikes therein; ſince he cannot caſt any aſperſion of Idolatry, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13333:108"/> vpon vs, but he is forced (except he will receaue a more dangerous Wound) to inſimulate the Fathers within the ſaid Errour.</p>
                  <p>Heere then I demand of them (for they are moſt fugitiue, and vncertaine in anſwering heereunto) will they acknowledge the Fathers Reuerence, Adoration, and praying to the Euchariſt it ſelfe? why then do they longer ſo pertinaciouſly perſiſt in defending their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarian doctrine? Will they ſeeke by inflexions, and wyndings to diuert the honor done to the Sacrament, to Chriſt only (repreſented therein) as he is in Heauen? If ſo, why doe theſe Anti-Saints, and Enemyes of Gods Seruants at other times ſpend themſelues out in ſuch eſtuation, and heate of rayling inuectiues (the ſcumne of baſe malice, and proper Scene of too many of our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaryes) againſt the Catholikes for performing that, which now for their owne aduantage in a different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, though like reaſon, they willingly (yet falſly) obtrude vpon the Fathers; thus if the Sacramentary do eſcape the ſword of <hi>Iehu,</hi> yet ſhall the ſword of <hi>Eliſaeus</hi> ſlay him; and thus we ſee, how weake this his anſwere is, wherein his gayne heere made, is like to the gayne of ground, which a running Water cauſeth, getting no more on the one ſide of the Banke, then it looſeth on the other.</p>
                  <p>This their Anſwere ſhalbe exemplified in that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>S. Dionyſius,</hi> who <hi>lib. de Hierarch. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 3. <hi>part.</hi> 3. thus writeth: <hi>O Diuiniſſimum, &amp; Sacroſanctum Sacramentum! obducta tibi ſignificantium ſignorum operimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta dignanter aperi, &amp; perſpicuè nobis fac appareas; noſtroſ<expan>

Where we ſee (beſides what is already ſaid) that <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> doth not heere inuoke Chriſt only before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as the Catholikes do before his Image) but he doth inuoke the Sacrament it ſelf, &amp; deſireth ſuch things of it, as are required only of God; from whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> thought, that Chriſt being God, and Man, was contained truly in the Sacrament, or rather, that Chriſt with the externall Symbols togeather was the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt, and laſt Ward, wherwith our Aduerſaries ſeeke to put by the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſly pointed Sentences of the Fathers, is appropriated only to ſuch their Authorities, wherin it is affirmed, that in the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, there is a true, &amp; Reall Sacrifice performed, meaning the offering vp by the words, and hands of the Prieſt the very Body, &amp; Bloud of Chriſt to his Father. Now, to theſe Authorities they frame an anſwere wouen of ſeuerall threeds, either of ignorant, or wilfull miſtakings. For, they ſay that the Euchariſt might be termed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Sacrifice for diuers reaſons. And firſt, by reaſon of the Oblation of the Faithfull, who in the Supper of our Lord do conſecrate themſelues to God. Or, of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the death of our Lord. Or of the diuers exerciſes of Piety (as of Faith, Hope, Penitency, Charity &amp;c.) or of Prayers, or of Thankſgiuing to God, or finally of the Almes: all which ſeuerall points, were particulerly performed (ſay they) in thoſe former ancient Tymes in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13333:109"/> the Celebration of the Euchariſt, &amp; which may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed Spirituall Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Now, that theſe Actions (ſuppoſing that in a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall conſtruction they might be ſo ſtyled, and were vſed then) are not vnderſtood in the former paſſages of the Fathers, I thus proue, in that thoſe Doctours plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach, that the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is offered vp in the Church, but thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Actions cannot be meant, and ſignified, (by any kind of ſpeach euer heard of) by the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt. As for example, <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> writeth <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>Etſi Chriſtus nunc non videatur offerre, ipſe tamen offertur in terris, cùm corpus eius offertur.</hi> Though Chriſt now may be thought not to offer vp <hi>(or ſacrifice)</hi> yet he himſelfe is heere offered vp vpon earth, when his body is offered vp.] Which wordes can in no ſort be applyed to thoſe former actions ſpecified to be in the Adminiſtration of the Euchariſt. Againe, the Fathers teach, that onely Prieſts, and no others can offer vp this Sacrifice. Thus doth <hi>S. Hierome epiſt. ad Euagrium,</hi> yea the Councell of <hi>Nyce</hi> it ſelfe exempteth Deacons from offering vp the Sacrifice: and <hi>Tertullian l. de velandis Virginum,</hi> Women in generall; and <hi>Epiphanius haereſ.</hi> 79. particulerly the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary;</hi> but it is manifeſt, that Prayers, Almes, Laudes, giuing of Thanks, an internall offering vp of the Soule (of all which points the former anſwere is aggregated) are offered vp, and performed by the whole People, much more then they may be by Deacons.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Branch of their Euaſions to the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities is deduced from the Etymologies of the word <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> or <hi>Sacrificare,</hi> which is but <hi>Sacra facere,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, becauſe the Conſecration, or Diſtribution
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13333:110"/> of the Euchariſt is <hi>Sacra actio,</hi> the Action, or Celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, is called <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> and the Miniſter, who perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſame, may be ſaid <hi>Sacrificare.</hi> which Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, or Dictionary Anſwere (vnworthy indeed the learned Eares of the Iudicious) is thus refelled. Firſt, becauſe in all Etymologies we are to reſpect <hi>non tam àquo quàm ad quid;</hi> not ſo much the Primatiues, or Originalls from whence they are deriued, as the applications, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by vſe, and cuſtome they are particulerly tied. And thus anſwerably hereto, we graunt that Baptiſme is <hi>Sacra actio</hi> (ſince it is <hi>Lauacrum Regenerationis)</hi> and yet we cannot read in any place of their Writings, where <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is called <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> or he who baptizeth, is ſaid <hi>Sacrificare.</hi> Againe, though euery ſacred Action might <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>abuſiuè</hi> be called a Sacrifice, yet this would aduantage our Aduerſaries nothing; ſince in the former teſtimonies of the Fathers, not the tranſient Action of celebrating the Euchariſt, but the permanent thing, which is ſacrificed (to wit the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt) is called by them the Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, though by this ſleight the Sacramentaries might ſeeme to wrench the ordinary, and naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all ſuch places, where the word <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> or <hi>Sacrificare</hi> is found, yet this is impertinent to diuers paſſages of the Fathers aboue cited, wherein the words <hi>Oblatio,</hi> or <hi>Offerre</hi> are. As that (beſides many others) of <hi>S. Auguſtine l.</hi> 4. <hi>de Trinitat. c.</hi> 14. <hi>Quid gratiùs offerri, aut ſuſcipi poſſit, quàm caro Sacrificij noſtri corpus effectum Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis noſtri?]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third, and laſt kynd of their expounding the former Authorities, is, that the Supper of our Lord is called a Sacrifice, or an Oblation, becauſe it includeth
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13333:110"/> in it ſelfe a certaine Commemoration, or Repreſentation of a true Sacrifice, viz. of the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>To this we reply, that it is true, that the Action of the Euchariſt is a Similitude, or Memoriall of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Croſſe: yet hence it followeth not, that the Fathers therefore thought not, that a true, and proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was offered vp in the celebration of the Euchariſt. Now, that the Fathers did belieue the Euchariſt to be a true Sacrifice, and not only a repreſentatiue Sacrifice, is clearely euicted out of theſe enſuing obſeruations. Firſt, becauſe Baptiſme is a Sacrament repreſenting the death of Chriſt; for the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. teacheth, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion of the partie baptized repreſenteth the death of Chriſt, and the taking him out of the Water, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, and yet no one of the Fathers doe terme Baptiſme a Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the Fathers do often adioyne certaine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, which are peculiar only to a true Sacrifice: Thus <hi>S. Cyprian l.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 3. calls the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt. <hi>Plenum, &amp; Verum Sacrificium:</hi> and S. Chryſoſtome, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium terribile, &amp; plenum horroris.</hi> Which Adiuncts are moſt fondly giuen to a meere repreſentatiue Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Fathers diuers times doe vſe the words <hi>Victima,</hi> and <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> in the plurall number (ſo doth <hi>S. Cyprian l.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;. l.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but this phraſe were moſt improper if it ſhould be vnderſtood of the Euchariſt, as it is only a commemoration of the death of Chriſt; for ſince only one thing is heere repreſented, therefore the name therof is to be deliuered only in the ſingular number.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly if this conſequence were of weight: <hi>The Eucharist is a Repreſentation of the Sacrifice of</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:13333:111"/> 
                     <hi>the Croſſe,</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is no true, and proper Sacrifice:</hi> then this Illation ſhould alſo be neceſſary (for both are wrought vpon one, and the ſelfe ſame frame) <hi>The Sacrifices of the old Law were repreſentations of the Sacrifice of the Croſſe,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were no true</hi> (but only repreſentatine) <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi> For as the Euchariſt is a Remembrance, &amp; Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the ſacrifice of the Croſſe already accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: ſo they were Repreſentations of the ſaid Sacrifice then to come.</p>
                  <p>And thus far concerning the Sacramentaries Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in generall, wherwith they labour to corrupt the moſt forcible, and conuincing places of the Fathers (ſo the <hi>Harpyes</hi> euer defiled the pureſt meates.) Indeed they preuayle with ſome of the vulgar ſort, whoſe Iudgments are ſo aëry, vaporous, and light, as that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſcend into the depth of any exquiſite enquiry of things; and ſo by theſe ſleights our Sectaries (rather then they will acknowledge the Fathers true meaning) do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne for the tyme their honour, &amp; credit with ſuch their followers; but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this their Sophiſtry comes to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the cleare, and impartiall iudgment of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either Catholike, or Proteſtant: then are their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers found to be attended with ſuch violent, and forced conſtructions of the Fathers writings, neceſſarily exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forth ſtrange improbabilities, miſtakings, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities; as that they being once ſcanned, are the cauſe of their greater, and more ſhamefull future ouerthrow. And thus their fortune heerin may ſeeme to partake of the misfortune of the poore Hare, which for a time by the help of her feet, auoyds the danger of the Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, but yet after, her ſaid feet betray her a new to her enemies, to her greater perill.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:13333:111"/>
                  <p> Now, I will cloſe vp this Chapter with one weighty conſideration<hi>:</hi> It is this. Wheras the Fathers haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Euchariſt moſt reuerently in all fulnes, and tranſcendency of ſtile (as appeareth out of their places alledged) ſo as if their ſayings be not to be diſueſted of their litterall ſenſe, then they irrefragably (euen by our Aduerſaries confeſſions) do warrant our Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. How chanceth, that not one Father (among ſo many) would neuer giue ſome caution, nor the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, that either his owne Sentences, or thoſe of the reſt of them (as being powred out in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, all magnifying, and aduancing the dignity of this Myſterie) were not to be taken litterally, but that they were Hyperbolical ſpeaches deliuered by them, only by way of Rhetoricall amplifications? What can our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries reply heerunto? Shall we charge all the Fathers with forgetfulnes in ſuch a point? But that is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, conſidering the weight of the matter, &amp; their accuſtomed ſollicitude in things of leſſer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence? Or ſhal we think, that being maliciouſly bent againſt all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, they determinately did leaue behind them ſuch ſayings, therby to diſſeminate Idolatry (for no leſſe a fault can it be eſteemed in them, if purpoſely they did write heerin otherwiſe, then they thought) in the minds of all Readers? But what Chriſtian is ſo voyd of Charity, and Senſe, as to traduce ſo many holy Fathers liuing in thoſe purer tymes with ſo heatheniſh, and helliſh an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? Nay I will proceed further in this Point: It is moſt cleare that the Fathers were ſo far from giuing any ſuch caution for the ſenſing of their writings, that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue left a caution iuſt to the contrary, I meane, that their ſayings touching the Euchariſt are not to be peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13333:112"/> by any Figuratiue, or Allegoricall conſtructions, but as the words doe lye, are ſo to be taken.</p>
                  <p>The preſident of <hi>Hilarius</hi> (a very ancient, and Learned Father) ſhall heere ſerue in place of many, who as it were through a Prenotion, and foreſight of this our Schiſmaticall Age (guided by him, with whom there is no Priority or Laterneſſe of Tyme) hath ſet downe his Syntax, or Grammar for the conſtruction both of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the reſt of the Fathers in all paſſages touching the Euchariſt.

Notwithſtanding (contrary heerto) I haue thought good in this Queſtion of the Euchariſt, thus far to deferre the placing of the ſtate therof (except what is ſcatteringly touched, as occaſion ſometimes hath ſerued) Which diſlocation (I hope) is iuſtly excuſable, ſince we are not alwayes ſeruily to tye our ſelues to other Mens precepts, for in the beſt Writers ſomtimes, Art hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled Art, &amp; Method lyed in breach of Method. My reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heerin is, to preuent a tedious, and needleſſe repetition of one, &amp; the ſame thing, for ſeeing in this Chapter we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew, that the doubtful, &amp; obſcure places, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed out of the Fathers writings for the impugning of our Catholike faith, do not in any ſort diſable the ſame; it is certaine, that this point will be beſt cleared, by ſetting downe, what the Catholikes do hould in this ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie: ſince in a true vnfoulding, &amp; explication therof, we ſhall find virtually included the ſolutions of the chief obiected Paſſages; thus ſhall we diſcouer, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries greateſt Peeces of this nature, wherwith in vaine they play vpon the impregnable Fort of Chriſts owne words, are but charged with certaine rouing, and hurtleſſe paper bullets of wreſted Authorityes.</p>
                  <p>Well then, firſt we teach, that notwithſtanding the true, and reall being of Chriſts Body, and Bloud vnder the externall formes of Bread, and Wine, the Euchariſt may be termed a ſigne in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is a Signe, ſince it repreſenteth the Body of Chriſt dying vpon the Croſſe, and his Bloud ſhed vpon the ſame, anſwerably to that of <hi>S. Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Domini annunciabitis, donec veniat:</hi> You ſhall ſhew the death of our Lord vntill he come.] Which wordes doe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13333:115"/> truly paraphraſe that ſaying of our Sauiour, <hi>Hoc facite in mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comemorationem:</hi> hauing therin relation to his Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now in this reference we hould, that the Euchariſt is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from his Body, and Bloud, ſince it is not heere in the ſame manner, as it was vpon the Croſſe; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament being therof but a repreſentation, or comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration. And in this ſenſe of the Euchariſt being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a ſigne doth <hi>Ignatius Epiſt. ad Philadelph.</hi> diſtinguiſh the Euchariſt from Chriſts Body, and Bloud.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe alſo <hi>S. Ambroſe Coment. in c.</hi> 11. <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>ad Cor.</hi> writeth, that the Body, and Bloud, which were offered for vs vpon the Croſſe, are ſignifyed in the Euchariſt; as alſo he there ſaith, that the myſticall Cup is a Type of our Lords Body, &amp; Bloud. The ſame conſtruction doth <hi>Baſil</hi> receaue, who in his Liturgy calles the Euchariſt <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is the Figure of Chriſts Body.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto alſo are referred thoſe words of <hi>S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome Homil.</hi> 83. <hi>in Matth.</hi> there calling the Euchariſt <hi>Symbolum Paſsionis Chriſti.</hi> And the ſame conſtruction is to be giuen to that ſo often obiected place of <hi>S. Augustine epiſt.</hi> 23. <hi>ad Bonifacium,</hi> where he teacheth, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments haue a ſimilitude, or likeneſſe of the thinges, wherof they are Sacraments; and that the Sacrament of the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt is, <hi>ſecundum quemdam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt, meaning thereby, that though the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt be in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, according to it true ſubſtance; yet it is not there as it was vpon the Croſſe, but only in ſimilitude; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this place <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes of the Paſſion, and Death of Chriſt. And this very explication doth that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimony of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> admit <hi>lib. contra Adiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. c.</hi> 12. where he ſaith, that our Sauiour in giuing his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13333:116"/> Body, did giue the ſigne of his body, which will cleerely appeare to any one, who with deliberation will conſider the place.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reſpect, wherein the Euchariſt may be called a ſigne, is becauſe it is a Sacrament, and euery Sacrament (according to part of it definition) is <hi>Signum rei Sacrae.</hi> For we hold that thoſe externall ſpecies of bread, and wyne doe ſignify the true Body, and Bloud of Chriſt lying vnder them. And in this reference of the externall formes to the body, and bloud veyled vnder them, are to be vnderſtood <hi>Origen in c.</hi> 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> where he calles the Euchariſt a <hi>Typicall Body. Ambroſe l. de my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterijs initiandis c.</hi> 9. where he ſaith, that after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the Body of Chriſt is ſignified.</p>
                  <p>Now out of theſe Premiſſes we may collect, that it is a diſſolute, and looſe kynd of reaſoning thus to inferre; The Fathers doe call the Euchariſt a ſigne, or Type of Chriſts Body, and Bloud: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they taught, that his body, and bloud were not really in the Euchariſt. For theſe two poynts (as we haue ſhewed aboue) are not incompatible, but may ſtand togeather; for euen in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane matters we find, that one, and the ſame thing may be a ſigne of a thing, and the thing ſignified: thus the wares ſtalled forth in a ſhop (as ſilke, cloth &amp;c.) are ſignes of merchandize to be ſould, &amp; are themſelues mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize to be ſould. Therefore if our Aduerſaries will produce any auaileable authority touching this point, they muſt alledge the Fathers, teaching, that the Euchariſt is only a ſigne of Chriſts Body, or that it is a meere repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a thing being abſent<hi>:</hi> but ſuch Fatherleſſe Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as theſe, cannot yet be found in the wrytings of the Fathers.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:13333:116"/>
                  <p> And ſeeing, that the Euchariſt is (as we teach) a repreſentation of Chriſts Body, and Bloud in ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſenſes. I will add (as an appendix hereto) an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation of certaine places of the Fathers, wherein the Word <hi>Repraeſento</hi> is vſed; the places be, <hi>Tertullian l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Marcionem. S. Hierome in c.</hi> 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> Theſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonyes our Aduerſaries doe obiect, in that, it is there ſaid, that the Euchariſt doth repreſent Chriſt, or the body, and bloud of Chriſt, or the like. For the true meaning of which teſtimonyes, we are to obſerue, that the Verbe <hi>Repraeſento,</hi> is ambiguous, for it ſignifieth to make a thing preſent, either truly, and really, or elſe only in ſigne, and figure. Now we ſay, that theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did vſe this word in the firſter ſignification, to wit, that Chriſt did truly, and really exhibite his Body, in that, which was bread afore. Which point we proue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Fathers haue elſe where writen moſt cleerely, and euidently in behalfe of the Reall Preſence, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if theſe their Authorities were otherwiſe to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then ſhould they either retract their former doctrine (whereof there is no ſigne) or elſe ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſe, &amp; contradict themſelues; wherewith to charge them were moſt abſurd.</p>
                  <p>That the Verbe <hi>Repraeſento,</hi> is ſometimes taken to exhibite, or make a thing preſent truly, and really, I will content my ſelfe with the teſtimony euen of <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelfe. For he <hi>lib. contra Praxeam,</hi> calleth Chriſt the Sonne, the Repreſentation of the Father, and yet the Father is truly in the Sonne. In like ſort, when God the Father ſaid in <hi>Mount Thabor: Hic eſt filius meus &amp;c. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian l.</hi> 4. <hi>in Marcionem</hi> ſaith<hi>: Ita<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> iam repraeſentans eum: Hic eſt filius meus;</hi> meaning, that, God the Father, who
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13333:117"/> ſometimes had promiſed his Sonne, did repreſent him truly, when he ſpake thoſe former words in the Mount.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Point, which we are to obſerue in the ſtate of this Queſtion, is; That the Euchariſt euen after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is by the Scripture ſometimes called Bread, for ſo we find it termed by the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Panis quem frangimus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Bread which we breake, is it not the participation of the Body of Chriſt?]</hi> Now, this appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be for a double reaſon. Firſt, in that it is an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Dialect of Scripture to call a thing by that name, which afore it was, or of which it is made (as hertofore I haue ſhewed.) Thus we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. that <hi>Eue</hi> is called the Bone of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe ſhe was made therof. And <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xod.</hi> 7. the Serpents of <hi>Moyſes</hi> are termed Wands, becauſe the Wands were turned into Serpents. For this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we find, that the Euchariſt is ſomtimes called Bread by the Fathers (which places our Aduerſaries are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to obiect againſt vs.) Examples heerof we haue in <hi>Origen l.</hi> 8. <hi>contra Celſum,</hi> where he calles the Euchariſt <hi>Panes oblatos,</hi> Bread which are offered vp in Sacrifice; where inſtantly after he ſhewes, that Bread is changed into the Body of Chriſt, therby diſtinguiſhing it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread. In like ſort, the Euchariſt is called by <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Haereſ c.</hi> 34. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the meate, or bread ſanctified,</hi> or <hi>made the Euchariſt.</hi> In this ſenſe alſo the Euchariſt is called bread by <hi>Ignatius epist. ad Philadelph. Chryſostome</hi> alſo <hi>homil.</hi> 24. <hi>in prior. ad Cor</hi> calleth the Bread, the Body of Chriſt, meaning bread conſecrated, &amp; not common Bread. Finally, <hi>S. Augustine c.</hi> 19. <hi>l. de fide ad Petrum,</hi> calles the Euchariſt, the Sacrament of Bread, &amp; Wine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon, why the Euchariſt may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13333:117"/> Bread by the Scripture, is, in regard of the ſimilitude, which it hath with bread; I meane, in nouriſhing the ſoule, as the bread nouriſheth the body; And in this ſenſe it is ſo called in <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. <hi>Panis: quem ego dabo, caro mea eſt pro mundi vita:</hi> The bread, which I will giue, is my fleſh for the life of the world. And by reaſon alſo of the ſaid reſemblance, we find the Euchariſt termed Bread by the Fathers; for <hi>Dionyſius Eccleſ. hierarch. c.</hi> 3. <hi>part.</hi> 3. calles the Sacrament <hi>Diuine, and Heauenly Bread;</hi> for the ſame reaſon <hi>Tertullian l.</hi> 3. <hi>contra Marcion.</hi> termes the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt Bread, to wit, the bread of Life; for there the Trope is, that the Body of Chriſt is called Bread, becauſe it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth like bread; and not, that the bread is there called the Body. Betweene which two Propoſitions there is great difference, ſince the firſt (which is commonly vſed by the Fathers) to wit, the Body of Chriſt is Bread, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth a true being there of Chriſts Body, but yet (in regard of nouriſhing our ſoules) with ſome reſemblance of bread; wheras the other Propoſition (to wit the bread is the Body of Chriſt) neither hurteth, nor aduantageth our cauſe, ſince therto is only required, that bread be in the Euchariſt, as far forth, as belong to ſignification; that is, that the externall formes therof be there, for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Accidences only, the bread, and wine do ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify; thus may Bread be ſaid to be ſome where in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it Accidences only, and not of it Subſtance: though the body of Chriſt hath not any ſuch relation of being, I meane, only in regard of it Accidences, &amp; not of it Subſtance. And heere we may ſee, how our Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries diſſent from the Fathers; ſince they alluding to the nouriſhment therof, doe figuratiuely call the body of Chriſt, Bread; wheras the other, with reference only to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13333:118"/> a naked repreſentation, do figuratiuely call the Bread, the Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of theſe two Reaſons, why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the Fathers doe ſometimes call the Euchariſt, Bread, or Wyne. Whereunto I might adioyne a third cauſe, in that the Scripture (and conſequently the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) doth often call things, as they externally appeare to the Eye; So the Scripture (as aboue I ſhewed) calles Angells, which appeared in humane ſhape, Men; the Braſen Serpent, a Serpent &amp;c. Wherefore the Euchariſt may be tearmed Bread, and Wyne either by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or the Fathers, in that to the Eye, it ſeemeth only as Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>To this point I thinke good to range this one Note touching the writings of the Fathers, which is, that ſome of the Fathers (though moſt ſeldome) do ſay that the ſubſtances of the externall Symboles doe remaine after Conſecration; Where they are to be vnderſtood, that they ſpeake of the eſſence, and nature of the Accidences, and not of the ſubſtances of Bread, and Wyne: An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample whereof we find in <hi>Theodoret Dialog.</hi> 2. who there teacheth, that the Myſticall ſignes after conſecration do remaine in their former ſubſtances, figure, and forme. Now this is meant of the nature of the accidences, and not of the Subſtance of bread, and wyne; This is proued diuers wayes: firſt, becauſe the two Greeke words. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (both which <hi>Theodoret</hi> being a greeke Father heere vſeth) containe euery kind of eſſence, and nature, aſwell of accidences as of ſubſtances. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth expound himſelfe in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſaying that we ſee, and touch the ſaid colour, and forme, which words haue neceſſarily reference only
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:13333:118"/> to the outward Accidences. Thirdly, in that we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes doe vrge this very place in proofe of the Reall Preſence, for heere <hi>Theodoret</hi> plainly ſaith, that the Body of Chriſt is to be vnderſtood, to be belieued, and adored in the Euchariſt; and therefore to be vnderſtood, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, adored (ſaith he) becauſe the bread of the Euchariſt (to wit, the bread conſecrated) is truly that, which is vnderſtood, belieued, and adored.</p>
                  <p>The ſame expoſition doth a Teſtimony alledged out of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> admit <hi>lib. de duabus naturis;</hi> which teſtimony we alſo produce, in that, it teacheth, that the bread is changed into a diuine ſubſtance by the working of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus we ſee, that the Sacramentaries are not aſhamed (ſo needfull, and begging of proofes is Hereſy) out of the leaſt appearance of aduantage, or naked ſound of wordes; to retort the very ſame ſayings of the Fathers againſt vs, in which, we for the fortifying of our Catholike doctrine do vehemently inſiſt; Belike they thinke, that the Fathers were irreſolute in their faith, or that their writings doe ſtand according to the Proſpectiue of ech Mans humor, ſo as the Senſe may that way looke, as euery Eye (behoulding the words) would haue it.</p>
                  <p>Heere now I will end this conſideration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt being called bread, with a ſhort animaduerſion of our Aduerſaries petulant frowardnes diſcouered herein, who lighting vpon ſome few ſtraying paſſages, where the Euchariſt is called Bread, preſently (as if they had found another <hi>Sparta,</hi> to enrich with their diſcourſe) they crie out in great prodigality of words, that it is nothing but materiall bread; and yet when in euery leafe, or page of the Fathers workes vpon this matter, they find it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13333:119"/> termed, the Body, and Bloud of Chriſt, all ſuch places (or elſe we wrong them) muſt needs be interpreted figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely: Thus inſiſting much in thoſe phraſes, which are but rare in the Fathers, and paſſing ouer with a cenſuring neglect, ſuch forme of ſpeaches, as moſt frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in their bookes.</p>
                  <p>A third Point, which we hould in this high Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is, touching the effect therof, of which, much hath bene already deliuered, only heere it will be neceſſary to recapitulate ſome of the former matter. Heere we teach that though the end therof be principally to feed our Soules, yet doth it giue a ſpirituall nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes; ſince our Bodyes therby are nouriſhed to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, taking euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the touch of Chriſts Fleſh a certaine diſpoſition to a glorious reſurrection, and immortall life, ſorting to that of <hi>Iohn c.</hi> 6. <hi>Qui manducat meam carnem</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</hi> Now though the Fathers in their Writings do conſpire with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and vs heerin; yet will our Aduerſaries peruert ſuch their Teſtmonies, who finding, that they ſay, that the Euchariſt doth nouriſh our bodyes ſomtimes without any further explication of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, do therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inforce, that ſince Chriſts Body doth not nouriſh our bodies, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only bread, and wine, and not his Body, is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; ſo materially, and groſſely do our Aduerſaries miſtake the Fathers iudgments heerin. Examples of this we haue in many of the Fathers, as <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Haereſ. Nyſſenus Orat. catechet. c.</hi> 36 <hi>&amp;</hi> 37. beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others heertofore alleaged; So as theſe very places aſcribing (according to their true expoſition) a greater vertue to the Euchariſt, then our Aduerſaries will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13333:119"/> may fully inſtruct vs (as before is ſhewed at large) that the Fathers belieued the very Body, &amp; Bloud of Chriſt to be in the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Point alſo toucheth the efficacy of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; for we teach, that the fruite, and benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſteth not in delighting our Bodyes (as corporall meates do) but in nouriſhing, and ſtrengthening of our Soules: and therfore in reſpect of the effect, and fruite therof, to eate the fleſh of Chriſt, is to belieue in him, &amp; to remaine in him by Charity. This we deduce out of the words of our Sauiour himſelfe, who ſpeaking of this Myſterie <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. thus ſaith<hi>: Spiritus est, qui viuificat</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is the ſpirit which quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> And againe, ſubioyneth to the former words<hi>: Verba quae ego</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The words which I haue ſpoken to you are ſpirit, and life.]</hi> The meaning of which latter ſentence (being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with the former) inſtructeth vs, that a carnall vnderſtanding of the Euchariſt, as if it ſhould be eaten as other meates are (for ſo the <hi>Capharnaites</hi> framed to themſelues) auayleth nothing; but that we ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that things diuine, and ſpirituall are heere deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs, which we are not to entertaine in a humane ſenſe, but by faith, and apprehenſion inſpired by God; yet ſo by faith, as that we belieue Chriſts ſacred Body, and Bloud to be heere truly, and really taken.</p>
                  <p>Hence now it is, that the Fathers reſting vpon the former words of Chriſt, and therfore chiefly ayming at the auaylable receauing of the Euchariſt, do write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that we are to eate the Body of Chriſt by Faith, and not with teeth, not excluding therby a corporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of Chriſt (as the Sacramentaries do ſuggeſt) but teaching, that the benefit, and operation of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13333:120"/> is chiefely to nouriſh, and fortify our Soules with ſpirituall, and Theologicall vertues. In this ſenſe is <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> to be vnderſtood in ſeuerall paſſages of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>de Coena Domini,</hi> who there thus concludeth: <hi>Quod eſca eſt carni, hoc animae est fides.</hi> In the ſame conſtruction alſo is <hi>Athanaſius (tract.</hi> vpon the wordes, <hi>Quicum<expan>

                           </am>

The ſame Interpretation is to be made of <hi>S. Auguſtine tract.</hi> 25. <hi>in Ioan. Quid paras dentem, &amp; ventrem? crede, &amp; manducaſti.</hi> And <hi>tract.</hi> 26. <hi>Credere in eum, hoc eſt, manducare panem viuum;</hi> though the one (if not both) of theſe places by the iudgements of ſome, not without great probability, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not of the Euchariſt, but of the ſpirituall eating of Chriſt, through faith, and beliefe of his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>Now out of this former ground reſultes an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation not to be neglected, to wit, that ſeeing the effect of the Euchariſt is, that the ſoule may remaine in Chriſt by faith and charity, and that ſuch, as doe not truly belieue in Chriſt, doe not with the intended fruit thereof eate the Sacrament; therefore the Fathers (leuelling only at the benefit, which the Receauers reape thereby) doe write ſomtimes, that the Misbelieuers, and Men of bad life, do not eate in the Sacrament the body, and bloud of Chriſt; which ſayings our Aduerſaries doe moſt calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly wreſt, inferring from thence, that the Fathers doctrine was, that ſuch misbelieuers, and other wicked perſons do not take at all the Body, &amp; Bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and that therefore his Body, and Bloud is not in the Euchariſt; which is moſt farre from their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:13333:120"/> meaning; who in ſuch places (as I haue ſaid) haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only to the profitable eating of Chriſts Body, whereof the wicked are not partakers. In this ſenſe is to be vnderſtood <hi>Origen. in</hi> 15. <hi>Matth. S. Hierome in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in c.</hi> 66. <hi>Iſaiae. &amp; in c.</hi> 22. <hi>Ieremiae;</hi> and finally S. <hi>Auguſtin. tract.</hi> 59. where he ſaith, that the reſt of the Apoſtles did eate <hi>Panem Dominum,</hi> but <hi>Iudas</hi> only <hi>Panem Domini,</hi> becauſe he receaued no fruite by his eating: See him alſo in <hi>ſermone de Verbis Apoſtoli,</hi> where he writeth, that the wicked doe not take the body of our Lord, who (as chiefly inſiſting in a fruitfull eating thereof) there ſaith: <hi>I llud manducare, refici eſt: I llud bibere, quid eſt niſi credere?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning the true ſtate of this queſtion of the Euchariſt, which being heere ſincerely ſet downe, may ſerue to ſalue diuers ſuch places of the Fathers, as ſeeme to fortify, and ſtrengthen the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentarian Hereſy. Some other few Paſſages there are, of which our Aduerſaries take hould, which receaue their Anſweres out of the circumſtances of ſuch places, ſo as an obſeruant Reader (carefully there noting the ſcope of the Father, as alſo the words precedent, &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent) may eaſily find out; and therefore, as not being reduced to any one generall head of explication, I remit them (for greater breuity) to the ſtudious ſearch of the iudicious Reader.</p>
                  <p>But before I finiſh this Chapter, I will ſubnect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome few ſhort animaduerſions, which a diſcreet Reader may take as a Correctiue, wherwith to taſt the more obſcure writings of the Fathers herein without da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; The which obſeruations, in that they ſhall not be meerely aëry, and ſpeculatiue, or like Accidences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:13333:121"/> Subſtances, I will make choyce of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whome they ſhall (as I may terme it) inhere; exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them in him (rather then in any other) becauſe our Aduerſaries in this Controuerſie with great vendication, and ſhew of confidence, ſeeme to rely vpon this Father.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, he is to know, that the Fathers omitting ſometimes the literall ſenſe of the words of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, or Apoſtles (as confeſſed) do giue ſome other Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, or Myſticall interpretation of them (which courſe they often vſe in expoſition of other parcells of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.) After this manner <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> paſſing ouer the immediate, literall, and acknowledged ſenſe of eating Chriſts Body, thus ſaith, <hi>in</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioan. Credere in eum, hoc eſt, manducare carnem eius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Animaduerſion may be, diligently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the more cleare places of a Father touching the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, with the more doubtfull of the ſame Father; for it is true, that their Writings do affoard ſome darke ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings touching this Myſterie; but it as is true, that they do miniſter vs moſt pregnant, and vnanſwerable proofes for our Catholike doctrine heerin; Thus do we find, that diuers paſſages alleaged out of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly, <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 33. <hi>concion.</hi> 1. vpon the words, <hi>Et ferebatur manibus ſuis:</hi> and <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de Trinit. c.</hi> 10. diſputing vpon the formes, wherin the Angells appeared, and, <hi>in Pſal.</hi> 98. vpon the words, <hi>Adorate ſcabellum pedum eius;</hi> do more ſtrongly proue, and fortifie this our Catholike doctrine, then any other Countertexts obiected out of him, do weaken it. Seeing then, that <hi>Augustine</hi> vnretracted, doth not impugne <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is followeth euen in reaſon, that the more obſcure paſſages are to be illuſtrated by the more perſpicuous, and euident, and not the contrary;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13333:121"/> ſince Darkeneſſe cannot giue Light to light: nor Vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty become a Rule of Certainty.</p>
                  <p>A third Caution is, to remember that ſome of the ancient Fathers are ſo full, and reſolute in this point, as that euen by the acknowledgment of all, they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any ſolutions, but confeſſed (and therfore reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) to confirme the Reall Preſence. Now, ſeeing that ſuch Fathers ſo writing are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicted by any other Fathers; it is therfore from hence neceſſarily inferred, that thoſe other Fathers, that write more obſcurely ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did neuertheleſſe conſpire, and agree with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in doctrine heerin: which contradiction of any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſme in Religion, we find to haue bene in all ages; as appeareth (to omit the examples of <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> by the many regiſtred Hereſies by <hi>Irenaeus, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> If then <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> had written heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contrary to the plaine teſtimonies of his age, or the immediate tymes after him, is it probable, that none of them would haue taxed him, as ſwaruing in this point from the vnity of Faith? Or if the Fathers of his dayes, &amp; other precedent tymes, had in ſuch their perſpicuous ſayings of the Euchariſt broached a new Hereſie in the Church, can we ſuppoſe, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, &amp; elaborately wrot of other mens hereſies) would haue bene ſilent in ſo important a matter?</p>
                  <p>A fourth Caution, which partly conſpireth with the former, is: That we are to obſerue, what Fathers in any age, haue liued in any ſtrait enter courſe of friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, eyther by writing, or otherwiſe. For we are to preſume, that the Faith of one of ſuch (if the contrary appeare not by wryting of eyther ſide) was agreable to the faith of the other. Seeing then, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> was
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13333:122"/> tyed moſt firmly in freindſhip with <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> (whoſe Teſtimonyes touching the Euchariſt, are acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for vs, euen by the Sacramentaries) how can it be probably preſumed, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſhould diſſent from him in ſo high a Myſterie, and yet on note, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof left in the monuments, and writings of either of them? How can it be (I ſay) that they ſhould mainly diſſent in faith, ſince vnity of faith was the band of their moſt freindly agrement? Or that they ſhould be Heretickes one to another, when their mutuall profeſſion of being ſcourges of Heretickes, gaue the firſt cementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtrenghtening to their inuiolable amity? Or finally (if we will belieue credible Authours) how could they ſo conſpiringly, and vnanimouſly (as if but one Soule had informed two Bodyes) haue ſayd in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Hymme of theirs, <hi>Te Deum laudamus, Te Dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitemur,</hi> if there had bin any diſparity in theyr worſhip of God, or different confeſſion of him, as their Lord?</p>
                  <p>The Fifth, and laſt Caution, which I will heere deliuer, is to weigh, whether the actions recorded by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Father do rather ſort to the doctrine of the Catholiks touching the Reall Preſence, or to the opinion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaryes, ſince the Fathers approbation of any ſuch workes, doth ſufficiently warrant in theyr Iudgements the fayth wherunto ſuch actions are truly appropriated. Thus anſwerably heerto we find, that <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 22. <hi>de Ciuit. Dei. c.</hi> 8. reporteth, that a certaine <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Houſe infeſted]</hi> The words of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> in that place are theſe<hi>: One Heſperius hauing his houſe infeſted with wicked ſpirits, to the affliction of his beaſts, and ſeruants, deſired in my abſence certaine of our Prieſts, that ſome would goe thither &amp;c. One went, and offered there the Sacrifice of the Body of Chriſt, praying what he might, that the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might ceaſe, and God being thereupon mercifull, it ceaſed.]</hi> Thus <hi>S. Auguſtine.</hi>
                     </note> houſe infeſted with wicked ſpirits, was deliuered of the ſaid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, through the offering vp of the Sacrifice of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt (as this holy Father there ſaith) by certaine Prieſts thither ſent. Now heere he ſaith not, that the particuler prayers of the Prieſts freed the houſe of them,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13333:122"/> neither can we thinke, that, that Learned Doctour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued the ſacrificing of a litle bread, and wine to worke ſuch ſtupendious effects; but he plainly affirmeth, that this great Miracle was performed by the offering vp of Chriſts Body, and Bloud; Therefore it followeth euen <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and demonſtratiuely, that <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, that Chriſts Body, and Bloud was truly, and really in the celebration of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>And thus much touching theſe Obſeruations. And now I will end this Chapter, affirming that in regard of what hath beene deliuered in this ſecond Part, we may be the more bold to reproue the precipitate, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blindneſſe of the Sacramentaries, who (by reaſon of ſome few ſcattered darke paſſages found in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are not aſhamed to vociferate, and crye mainly out with <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> the Hereticke in the Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon: We defend the opinions of the Fathers; We haue their Teſtimonyes, not by ſnatches, or at the ſecond hand, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their owne Bookes; Wee are caſt out with the holy Fathers:</hi> whereas indeed, theſe vauntes are as farre from being iuſtified, as their beliefe herein is diſtant from our Catholike beliefe.</p>

The like may we ſay of the writings of thoſe primitiue Fathers, which (next to the Sacred Scriptures) may be termed the Arke, or Tabernacle, wherin do lye entreaſured the riches of the Euangelicall Law. Of this Arke our Aduerſaries would ſeeme in the

By the acknowledgment of the Proteſtants the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is alſo moſt true, as ſhall euidently appeare out of their owne words, from the Reference <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <p>The firſt of theſe ſhalbe taken from <hi>Luther,</hi> whoſe malice towards the Pope (for indeed he breathed nothing but Malice, Pride, and Luſt) was ſo implacable, as that he endeauoured by all meanes poſſible to annoy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domage the Sea of Rome; and therupon (as the World knoweth) he did burſt out from the Catholike Church, by denying the moſt poynts denyed at this day by the Proteſtants.

And on the other ſide, vnwilling to recall (for Pryde cannot brooke a iuſt yielding, or ſubmiſſion to an Aduerſary) what they haue heertofore ſo pertinaciouſly defended, they haue therfore thought it good Policy, to ſuggeſt to the world, and Indifferency of this Point, that by ſo doing they may intimate to all, that though they erre therin (as hauing ſo many great Euidences againſt them) yet their Errour (not touching any Cardinall, &amp; ſupreme article of Faith) is the leſſe dangerous, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more ſufferable, and pardonable.</p>

                  <p>Thus the Philoſopher (for inſtance ſake) after he

                  <p>In like ſort, the Diuine conuincing againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, that Chriſt is both God, and Man, from the holy Scriptures, and the authority of the Church, doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant his doctrine with certaine perſwaſiue motyues, drawne from the conſideration of Gods Iuſtice, and the Atrocity of Sinne; including, that it was conuenient, that ſince Sinne did firſt deuide God from Man, he, who by redeeming the world, ſhould reunite them, ſhould be both God, and Man. And thus the firſter kind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth our Iudgment; the other, as ſorting with Reaſon, and Prudence, and in ſome ſenſe preſuming the former, ſerues only (as ſweet meates to our ſtomakes) pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cloſe vp our iudgment. The ſame order will I heere obſerue<hi>:</hi> For hauing (I truſt) already ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Truth of the Reall Preſence in the Euchariſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the former Authorities, drawne from the Word both of God, and Man, I will ſet downe certaine Congruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Prudentiall Reaſons, wherwith our Sauiour might well ſeeme to haue bene induced to leaue his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body to his Church, that by the authority, and diſpoſall therof, it might be truly, and really exhibited
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:13333:137"/> to all Chriſtians whatſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>And heere by reaſon of the great number of them, I will chiefly inſiſt in ſome few (for I am deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this Treatiſe within as ſmall a Compaſſe, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently I can) in regard whereof I will not much more enlarge my ſelfe vpon thoſe Effects, and Operations of this moſt heauenly food, which heretofore I haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by way of alledging the Fathers Authorities; which ſhew, that the Euchariſt is a Pledge of our Saluation; that by it we are not only by Faith, but euen corporally vnited with Chriſt; That in regard of this vnion, the Euchariſt is a Seale to vs of our Reſurrection; finally that through it we are made Partakers of the diuine Nature; All which admirable Effects and vertues, may probably be imagined (among other Motiues) to haue beene moſt preuayling with our Lord for the firſt inſtitution of this holy Myſterie; for Man cannot conceaue, how Chriſt could inuent more forcible meanes to produce ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall operations, then by inſtituting this Sacrament. In reſpect alſo of the ſame deſired expedition, I will not long reſt in diſplaying, and amplifying the dignity, and worth of ſuch Inducements, as I intend heere to vrge, but will paſſe them ouer with a curſory Penne, breifly intimating them to the ſtudious Reader.</p>
                  <p>Well then, one Inducement of the Inſtitution of this Sacrament may be, that ſeeing Mortall ſinne (which is the Harbinger of eternall damnation) cannot be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded altogeather, but by the Grace of God; what better meanes could his diuine Maieſty inuent for the watering our Soules with his Grace, then the ordayning of this Sacrament? for ſince we are hereby truly, and really vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Chriſt (the Fountaine of Grace) how can we

And therfore a Chriſtian Soule ought in this place to ſtriue through an height, and extremity of Loue (whoſe Nature is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate togeather things different) to be moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and inſeparably conioyned with her Creatour, euen dwelling, and reſiding in him, and ſo making good

                  <p>Another Reaſon of ordayning the Euchariſt, may be to bind all Chriſtians togeather not only by Charity, but euen in a certaine reall, and ſubſtantiall manner. Now this vnion is performed, in that all Chriſtians do communicate of one, and the ſame ſpirituall food; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe words of the Apoſtle (which though immediately they be appropriated to the former vnion of mind by Charity, yet may they well be extended to this more ſtraite, and intrinſecall vnion) <hi>Vnus</hi>

For if we conſider the thing heere giuen, or the giuer himſelfe (both being heere coincident, and both being God, and Man) or the end whereunto it was beſtowed, to wit, the ſpirituall nouriſhing of our Soules, or the ſmall deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Man receauing it, who dayly crucifieth him with his ſinnes, it will aſſure vs, that ſuch wonderfull Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence iſſued from a Sea of moſt vehement Loue, and Affection.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore his zeale to vs herein appeareth in that he is content by his entring into vs (a ſtrang affection which bringeth forth ſuch ſtrang effects) that we doe enter into him, and thus we are (without any diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red confuſion of things) in that meate, the which is in vs, himſelfe witneſſing no leſſe in thoſe words: <hi>Qui manducat meam carnem, &amp; bibit meum ſanguinem, in me</hi>

                  <p>There are many other Inducements (according to the iudgments of the Learned Fathers, and Doctours) which might inuite our Sauiour to leaue his Body, and Bloud in the Euchariſt; for they teach, that it is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sacrifice euer to continue in the Church: That it is a condigne, and worthy Sacrifice for Chriſt to offer vp to his Father: That it is a Sacrifice of Thankſgiuing for the Saints in Heauen: That it is not only for the Liuing, but for the Dead alſo a Propitiatory Sacrifice: That it is a Commemoration of Chriſts Paſſion<hi>:</hi> That it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of his Teſtament: That it is an Abſtract, or Abridgment of diuers of Gods chiefeſt Myracles: That in a ſort it Deifieth the Soule<hi>:</hi> That therby we haue God preſent vnder a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible obiect to heare our Prayers, which poynt mightily increaſeth our deuotion, and reuerence: Finally, that it is a <hi>Viaticum</hi> for the ſoules ready to depart out of this world.

And thus we ſee, how the Inſtitution of this
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:13333:140"/> Sacrament, and the many ſeeming inducements therof do in a different reſpect reciprocally preſuppoſe the one the other.</p>
                  <p>And hence therfore more euidently appeareth the froward obſtinacy of our Aduerſaries, who eyther not knowing, or not weighing theſe, and other ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of credibility, alledged in defence of the Reall Preſence, are not aſhamed to vrge (grounding themſelues vpon our Method heerin by way of a Contrariety) the vnprofitableneſſe therof, as alſo certaine Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Indignityes to Chriſt, proceeding in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion from this our Catholike Doctrine; affirming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſuch, as that they miniſter ſtrong probabilityes, that Chriſt would neuer leaue his Body, and Bloud to be giuen truly, and really in the celebration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. But this their Lightneſſe, and want of ſolide Iudgment, conſiſting in diſhonouring Chriſt vnder the texture of honouring him (ſo did the Iewes conuitiate him in words of Reuerence) ſhalbe diſcouered <note n="n" place="margin">
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hereafter in the Marginall Reference.]</hi> The chiefe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which our Aduerſaries doe alledge, both from the vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the Catholike doctrine, as alſo from the indignity, which ſeemes to be offered to Chriſts Body, are theſe following. And firſt touching the ſeeming indignity, and diſhonour redounding to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred body of Chriſt by the doctrine of the Reall Preſence: They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that from our doctrine it followeth, that the Body of Chriſt might fall, might be burnt, might become rotten, and mouldy (for ſo we ſee the externall ſymboles ſometimes to appeare) might be eaten by mice, ſhould paſſe into the belly, and ſo to the common paſſage &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>To all this we Anſwere; Firſt, that theſe ſuppoſed Indignities doe not touch the Body of Chriſt, but only affect the ſpecies, and formes of the Euchariſt, which are ioyned with the Body. As for example, when the conſecrated hoaſt falleth from the Altar vpon the Earth, yet cannot the Body of Chriſt be truly ſaid to fall; for that is ſaid properly and truly to fall, which doth exiſt, and is mooued corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (which cannot be properly ſaid of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt.) And therefore when a Man falleth on the ground, we vſe not to ſay, that his Soule falleth, though accidentally it changeth it place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Anſwerably therefore, we teach, that the Body of Chriſt exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting after a ſpirituall manner, and indiuiſibly in the Euchariſt, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it place, but properly falleth not, when the Hoaſt falleth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we anſwere, that ſeeing our Chriſtian faith, teacheth vs, that Chriſt was included for a long time in the wombe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; that he was ſwadled, and lapped in Cloaths; that then he might fall vpon the earth; and might alſo haue beene eaten with beaſts, or burnt (if ſo by miracle, he were not preſerued from ſuch miſchances) if then he was truly, and in his owne perſon ſubiect to all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties without any diſhonor; what diſhonour is it to him, if he did vndergoe (in another forme) the former ſuppoſed indecencyes vrged by our Aduerſaries?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The former Indignities do no more truly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly touch the Body of Chriſt, then the Diuinity (becauſe it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all places) can be ſaid to be burnt, it being in the fire, or to be rotten, it being in bodyes that are rotten &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this kind of our Aduerſaries arguing is borrowed from the old Hereticks, denying other poynts of Chriſtian Religion. Thus we find, that the <hi>Arians</hi> impugned the Diuinity of Chriſt (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from <hi>Hilarius l.</hi> 12. <hi>de Trinitate)</hi> from reaſons drawne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the honour, and dignity of the Father. In like ſort, the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioniſtes,</hi> denying the <hi>Incarnation</hi> did obiect (as we read in <hi>Tertullian lib. de carne Chriſti)</hi> that it was an Indignity to God, to be incloſed in the wombe of a woman, to lye in a Manger &amp;c. Finally, the <hi>Iewes</hi> chiefely reſt in obiecting againſt vs <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that we belieue in a Man <hi>(as Iuſtinus witneſſeth in Dialogo cum Tryphone) which was crucified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theeues</hi> By all which examples we are inſtructed, how litle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleable thoſe Arguments are, which our Aduerſaries doe draw from the Indignities (ſuppoſing that they were true) which ſeeme to proceed from our Catholike doctrine of the Euchariſt.</p>
                        <p>Now touching the vnprofitableneſſe of the Catholike doctrine in this point, our Aduerſaries do obiect, that the reall being of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt is needleſſe, in that ſeeing the end, and fruite of the Euchariſt is to nouriſh the Soule, and this nouriſhment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Faith, and Charity, may as auaileably be performed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Chriſt by faith, as he is only in Heauen; it followeth, that no profit ariſeth from the Catholike doctrine herein, which is not by other meanes aſwell effected.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwere: Firſt, that it is falſe to affirme, that the ſame fruite is reaped by apprehending Chriſt in heauen, as by receauing him really into our Bodyes; Since experience doth witneſſe, that by this receauing him in the Euchariſt, our Faith, Charity, Deuotion, and Reuerence are more increaſed<hi>:</hi> Beſides our Reall Coniunction with Chriſt affoardeth many benefits to the Soule, which Chriſt giueth not without this Coniunction; no otherwiſe then he cured all ſuch, as touched the hemme of his garment, whom he would not (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he could) if they had not touched it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is a falſe Illation, to conclude, It was not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that Chriſt ſhould be really in the Euchariſt, becauſe the fruite reaped therby, may be obtayned by other meanes; for that is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which doth conferre any good, though the ſame good may be obtayned by other wayes, for no man will deny, but that Chriſt could haue cured the ſicke, and infirme, if they belieued in him, though they had not touched his garments, or his hands, yet it followeth not that the touch therof was vnprofitable to them. In like ſort, one drop of Chriſts Bloud, or any laborious worke vndertaken by him for our good, had bene ſufficient for our Redemption; yet it followeth not, that all his paines, wounds, effuſion of his Bloud, and death it ſelfe were vnprofitably, and bootleſſely performed; yea God could haue redeemed the world without the Incarnation of Chriſt, ſhall we therfore ſay, that the Incarnation of Chriſt was needleſſe, inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and vnprofitable?</p>
                        <p>Finally, our Aduerſaries obiect, that the doctrine of the Reall Preſence is hurtfull, in that it followeth, that the Body of Chriſt is giuen to the wicked with prophaning therof. To which may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (beſides that, which is aboue ſaid, touching the Indignity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Chriſt by this Doctrine) that no inconuenience, or domage aryſeth to Chriſts body, being diſtributed to the wicked, but the great Charity of God is ſhewed therein; for we ſee that the Sunne-beames do light vpon moſt foule places, and putrifyed bodyes, they being in no ſort corrupted, or defiled therby; why ſhould then the Body of our Sauiour being after a ſpirituall, and ſupernaturall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Euchariſt, receaue any detryment, hurt, or loſſe, by it entring into the bodyes of the wicked?</p>

                           <hi>From reaſons drawne.]</hi> Seeing that the doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> doth euer preſuppoſe the Reall Preſence, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reaſons heere alledged are preuayling chiefly againſt the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, and all ſuch Proteſtants, as do acknowledge a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all being of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt. Therfore ſuppoſing that Chriſt would truly exhibite his body to vs, theſe Congruentiall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyues following may perſwade vs that he would not there haue it ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with bread, but to be abſolutely alone by it ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, in that if the ſubſtance of bread ſhould remaine with the body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt. Then two different Subſtances ſhould haue one and the ſame reſpect and relation to the ſame Accidences, and ſhould be demonſtreted by the ſame Accidences, as by certaine externall ſignes: And which is more, the firſt and principall relation of the Accidences ſhould be to the Bread, and only a ſecondary rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Body of Chriſt; the reaſon heerof being, in that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the bread (and not the Body of Chriſt) is informed with thoſe Accidences. But this would be moſt inconuenient, ſince from hence it would follow, that the Actions performed by the Prieſt, or the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municant ſhould firſt agree to the bread, &amp; ſecondarily only to the Body of Chriſt; And thus if one do aſke, what is eleuated, what is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or what the Accidences do there ſignify, or one ſhould then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, a peece of Wheaten Bread, and the Body of Chriſt; which poynt could not ſtand with the dignity and reuerence of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it would appeare much oppoſite to the dignity of Chriſts Body, that one and the ſame meate ſhould be nouriſhment both to our Soules and Bodyes, and it conſequently would breed in vs a leſſe reuerence to the Body of Chriſt there preſent.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſing the Bread to be in the Euchariſt, then could not the Euchariſt be taken faſting<hi>:</hi> and hence it followeth, that none could ſeuerall tymes communicate the ſame day: And yet according to <hi>S. Auguſtine epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>c.</hi> 6. euen by the Decree of the Apoſtles, the Body of Chriſt ought to be taken only of ſuch as are faſting: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it appeareth from <hi>S. Gregory homil.</hi> 8. <hi>in Euang.</hi> that vpon Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day the Prieſt did celebrate three tymes, during the tyme of the Primitiue Church.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly (and perhaps principally) it is fitting, that the bread ſhould not be in the Euchariſt with the Body of Chriſt, in regard of the danger growing therby, to wit, for feare that the more ignotant &amp; ſimple ſhould adore the bread, ſince ſuch do not diſtinguiſh, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely adore that which lyeth vnder the Accidences. Now that it was conuenient, that the Accidences of bread and wine ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and not be changed, appeareth by other like Reaſons of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>EERE now, <hi>Good Reader</hi> (for to thee only I will turne my pen, ſince my humble thoughts dare not preſume to direct any further ſpeeches vnto his <hi>Maieſty)</hi> thou haſt this meane, and impoliſhed diſcourſe, in regard of the Subiect whereof all Pens (yea the tongues of Angells) are to be reputed moſt vnworthy: from hence thou mayſt (according to my Method) be inſtructed of two things.

               <p>And concerning the firſt Point, we are to conceaue, that as in the firſter part hereof, it is demonſtrated, that God is <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> ſo doth our Chriſtian Faith teach vs, that he is <note n="a" place="margin">he is iuſt.] Pſalm. 11.</note>

Both theſe drawing equally togeather in him (for he hath <note n="b" place="margin">For he hath promiſed] Anſwerably to that of S. Iohn 6. Pauis, quem ego daho, caro mea eſt pro mundi vita.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the infallible Oracle of his written word, that he would giue his ſacred Body, and Bloud to eate, and drinke) may warrant vs of the Truth of this high My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Part (to conuince, that Chriſt at his laſt Supper performed, what afore was prooued, that he was able to accompliſh) thou haſt ſet downe all the chiefeſt Authorities drawne from Gods ſacred word; the anſwerable Propheſies of the Ancient Iewes herein; the beginning, and progreſſion of the Sacramentarian Hereſy particulerly diſplaied; the wreſted teſtimonies of Scriptures alledged to the contrary, fully and ſatisfying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered; the ſtupendious Miracles wrought in proofe hereof recorded; and laſtly (to omit other ſhort inſertions) the Fathers Iudgments in the ſame, as alſo in the particuler manner of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> moſt aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſted both by their owne expreſſe ſayings, and by the plaine acknowledgement of our Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.</p>
               <p>It now remaineth, that vpon the mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former Premiſſes, thou conſider (ſeeing with the <note n="c" place="margin">VVith the Pſalmiſt.] Pſalm. 24.</note> Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou haſt not receaued thy ſoule in vayne)</hi> to which ſide thou intendeſt to ſubiect thy iudgement herein. That is, whether thou wilt imbrace the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries opinion (notwithſtanding it is impugned by all forcible Proofes whatſoeuer) or that thou wilt be content (with all humble reſignation of thy owne ſpirit to impath thy ſelfe in the way of reuerend Antiquity, and to follow their iudgements who in Faith, and doctrine
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13333:144"/> followed the Apoſtles, I meane, the Iudgments of thoſe Primitiue Fathers, Men remarkeable for Learning, ſince their owne Labours (left as Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to Poſterity) are ſufficient witneſſes therof; Men of moſt eminent vertue, ſince God hath vouchſafed to ſeale their ſanctity of life with the irrefragable teſtimonies of diuers <note n="d" place="margin">Great Miracles.] Examples hereof ſee recorded in diuers Authors, and Hiſtoriographers.</note> great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles Finally men of a pure and vncorrupted Faith, ſince they then liued, when the Church of Chriſt was for her time, but in her Infancy, but for her perfection, in her youth and full growth, and therfore euen by the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Sectaries, could not with a ioynt conſent teach any thing contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And thus the maine drift of theſe precedent Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (for this is the Iſſue of the matter chiefly intended by me, and heere it reſteth) reſolues to this one poynt, to wit whether a Man deſirous of his owne ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould in this high, and moſt reuerend Myſterie (vpon the true or falſe beliefe wherof depends his ſoules interminable weale, or woe) run one, and the ſame lyne of faith with <hi>Auguſtine, Hierome, Chryſostome, Epiphanius,</hi> the <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> the <hi>Cyrills, Baſil, Ambroſe, Hilary, Athanaſius, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Irenaeus, Ignatius,</hi> and the like; or with <hi>Zuinglius, Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now ſince we are Chriſtians, and are to belieue in Chriſt, not in outward ſenſe; Let vs turne our pen from all diſputable Points of the matter, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the certainty, admire Gods inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therin; for as the Heauens ſpend their Motions by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing their Heat, Light, &amp; other vertues to the earth; ſo the Creatour of the Heauens hath vouchſafed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Grace by beſtowing himſelfe (in this moſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:13333:144"/> dreadfull Myſterie) vpon Man, the Earths chiefeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thus by receauing his ſacred Body, and Bloud, we containe him within our ſelues, whom the Heauens ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
